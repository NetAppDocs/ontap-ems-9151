*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Distributed Block Store (DBS) event such as a change in cluster pair connectivity status occurs. If the original DBS event specifies multiple drives, then an EMS event is generated for each drive.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
A DBS remote cluster event occurred, event %s, type %s, service %u, node %u/%s, drive %u/%s, eventID %u.
*Parameters*::
*evtMessage* (STRING): Description of the DBS event, including context details.
*evtType* (STRING): Type of the original DBS event.
*serviceID* (INT): Service ID that identifies the associated DBS service. It is 0 if there is no associated service.
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node. It is 0 if there is no associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Generated Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) of the associated node. It displays zeroes if there is no associated node.
*driveID* (INT): Drive ID number of the associated drive. It is 0 if there is no associated drive.
*driveUuid* (STRING): Generated UUID of the associated drive. It displays zeroes if there is no associated drive.
*evtID* (INT): DBS event ID number.
*evtDetails* (STRING): Specific details of the DBS event. It displays as a string, in JSON format, or is empty.

== dbs.remote.rep.cluster.full
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the distributed block store detects that the volumes have paused remote replication because the target storage cluster is full. The distibuted block store is responsible for managing the data that backs the flexible volumes.
*Corrective Action*::
Free target space.
*Syslog Message*::
The distributed block store detects that the volumes have paused remote replication because the target storage cluster is full. The cluster fault type is %s and fault id is %u.
*Parameters*::
*cfType* (STRING): Distibuted block store cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): Distibuted block store cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*cfDetails* (STRING): Description of the cluster fault, including context details.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): Distibuted block store cluster fault external source label created by the "CreateClusterFault" API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.
