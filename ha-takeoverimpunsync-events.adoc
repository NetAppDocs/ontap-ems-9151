== ha.takeoverImpUnsync
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the partner node is down and it is currently impossible to perform a takeover because the takeover node does not have partner NVRAM data.
*Corrective Action*::
Verify that the interconnect cables are correctly connected between the nodes. Boot the partner node to reestablish the interconnect if it was shut down. If necessary, force a takeover with the '[run node] cf forcetakeover' command. This action might cause data loss if there is NVRAM data on the partner node not written to disk.
*Syslog Message*::
Takeover of the partner node is impossible due to lack of partner NVRAM data.
*Parameters*::
(None).
