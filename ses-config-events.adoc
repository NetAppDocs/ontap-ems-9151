== ses.config.diskStackMaxError
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a stack of shelves contains more disk bays than the maximum number that are allowed.
*Corrective Action*::
Remove shelves from the storage stack until the the number of disk bays do not exceed the maximum number.
*Syslog Message*::
There are a total of %d disk bays on shelves attached to channel "%s", which exceeds the maximum number of disk bays (%d).
*Parameters*::
*numDiskBays* (INT): Number of disk bays on the storage stack.
*channelName* (STRING): Name of the adapter port or switch port connected to the storage stack associated with the error (for example, "7a" or "myswitch:5").
*maxDiskBays* (INT): Maximum number of disk bays that are allowed on the storage stack.

== ses.config.drivePopError
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the channel has more disk drives on it than are allowed. Systems using synchronous mirroring allow more disk drives per channel than other systems.
*Corrective Action*::
If synchronous mirroring is intended to be used, ensure that the license is installed. Otherwise, reduce the number of disk drives on the channel to no more than the maximum allowed.
*Syslog Message*::
Disk drive population is greater than %d in channel %s; this is an illegal configuration. Synchronous mirroring %s is enabled.
*Parameters*::
*fcalTenancy* (INT): Maximum number of disk drives allowed on this loop.
*channelName* (STRING): Name of the adapter port or switch port associated with the error; for example, "7a" or "myswitch:5".
*isIsNot* (STRING): Whether synchronous mirroring is enabled.

== ses.config.IllegalEsh270
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when ONTAP(R) software detects one or more Embedded Switched Hub (ESH) disk shelf modules in a disk shelf that is attached to a FAS270. This is not a supported configuration.
*Corrective Action*::
Replace the ESH modules with ESH2 modules.
*Syslog Message*::
One or more ESH modules are attached to a FAS270. This is not a supported configuration. Replace the ESH modules with ESH2 modules.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== ses.config.shelfMixError
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when the channel has a mixture of ATA and Fibre Channel disk shelves; this is not a supported configuration.
*Corrective Action*::
Mixed-mode operation of ATA and Fibre Channel disks on the system is only supported on separate loops. Move all Fibre Channel-based disk shelves to one loop and place all Fibre Channel-to-ATA-based disk shelves on another loop.
*Syslog Message*::
Disk shelves present on channel %s are of different drive types; this is not a supported configuration.
*Parameters*::
*channelName* (STRING): Name of the adapter port or switch port associated with the error; for example, "7a" or "myswitch:5".

== ses.config.shelfPopError
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the channel has more disk shelves on it than are allowed.
*Corrective Action*::
Reduce the number of disk shelves on the channel to the number specified.
*Syslog Message*::
Disk shelf population on channel %s is %d. Reduce the number of disk shelves on this channel to %d or fewer.
*Parameters*::
*channelName* (STRING): Name of the adapter port or switch port associated with the error; for example, "7a" or "myswitch:5".
*numShelves* (INT): Number of disk shelves on the port.
*maxShelves* (INT): Maximum number of disk shelves on a port.
