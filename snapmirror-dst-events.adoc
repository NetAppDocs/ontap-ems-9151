== snapmirror.dst.directoryOperationFailASCII
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event is issued when a SnapVault or Qtree SnapMirror destination encounters an error in a directory operation - typically creating an entry, or trying to move an entry to purgatory (for rename or delete), and the name entry consists only of ASCII characters.
*Corrective Action*::
It may be necessary to break and reinitialize the relationship. Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Logical replication destination directory operation failed: source inode %d, name="%s%s%s".
*Parameters*::
*srcInum* (INT): The inode number of the file (or directory, link, etc.) on the source system.
*n1* (STRING): The first of three name components. When combined, these will either be the path to the file on the destination system (usual case), or the NFS name and NFS alternate name of the directory entry (in those cases where we run into trouble building the full path).
*n2* (STRING): The second of three name components.
*n3* (STRING): The last of three name components.

== snapmirror.dst.directoryOperationFailIntl
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event is issued when a SnapVault or Qtree SnapMirror destination encounters an error in a directory operation - trying to create, rename, or delete an entry. This event can occur as a result of the conditions that cause burts 106216 and 110298.
*Corrective Action*::
If the destination volume's "vol lang" was changed after the baseline transfer, then the relationship may need to be broken and reinitialized. Please be aware that "vol lang" does not take effect on the volume until the filer is rebooted; thus, if a baseline transfer occurs after the setting was changed but before the filer was rebooted, then the "vol lang" actually changes after the baseline transfer takes place. If no change in the destination volume's "vol lang" has occurred, you may need to change the source volume's language to match that on the destination volume. For guidelines on this procedure, please contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Logical replication destination directory operation failed: source inode %d, name="%s%s%s". If the destination volume's "vol lang" was changed after the baseline transfer, then the relationship may need to be broken and reinitialized.
*Parameters*::
*srcInum* (INT): The inode number of the file (or directory, link, etc.) on the source system.
*n1* (STRING): The first of three name components. When combined, these will either be the path to the file on the destination system (usual case), or the NFS name and NFS alternate name of the directory entry (in those cases where we run into trouble building the full path).
*n2* (STRING): The second of three name components.
*n3* (STRING): The last of three name components.
