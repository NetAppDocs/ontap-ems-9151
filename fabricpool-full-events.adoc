*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the total, cluster-wide FabricPool space usage of object stores from capacity-licensed providers has reached the license limit.
*Corrective Action*::
To find the percentage of the licensed capacity used by each FabricPool, use the "storage aggregate object-store show-space" command. To create more space, delete Snapshot(tm) copies from volumes with the tiering policy "snapshot" or "backup" by using the "volume snapshot delete" command. To increase the licensed capacity, install a new license on the cluster.
