To free up more space on a volume, delete old Snapshot(tm) copies of the volumes on the aggregate by running the 'volume snapshot delete' command. b. To increase the size of a volume or an aggregate, add disks to the aggregate by running the 'storage aggregate add-disks' command.
*Syslog Message*::
The 'volume move' operation with ID '%jd' for volume '%s' present on Vserver '%s' cannot proceed (Reason: Not enough space in the volume or aggregate).

*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a "volume move" operation fails to take offline the quiesced volume remaining after moving a clone parent, because wafliron is running.

The "volume move" operation for the volume %s on vserver %s with job-id %jd could not offline the quiesced clone parent volume left behind.
*Parameters*::
*volName* (STRING): Name of the volume.
*vserverName* (STRING): Name of the Vserver.

== mgmt.vopl.rehost.failed
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a volume rehost job attempts to rehost a volume from one Vserver to another and is unsuccessful. This might happen if the target volume is being accessed by some other Data ONTAP(R) operations (for example, volume move); if the target volume is in a relationship, such as a SnapMirror DP relationship; or if the aggregate hosting the volume is undergoing a wafliron process. The system makes its best effort to revert the rehost procedure and make the volume available under the source Vserver. Subsequent attempts to rehost this volume might be successful; if the volume rehost revert procedure still fails, use the command "debug vreport" to fix volume discrepancies.
*Corrective Action*::
Follow the instructions provided as part of the volume rehost error and retry the operation after some time. If the volume rehost revert procedure fails and there are volume discrepancies, use command "debug vreport" in diagnostic mode to fix volume discrepancies.
