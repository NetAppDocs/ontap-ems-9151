== sms.common.snapshot.failed
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when there is a failure in creating a common Snapshot(tm) copy. The SnapMirror(R) Sync relationship continues to be in "in-sync" status.

Create a common Snapshot copy manually by using the "snapmirror update" command at the destination volume.
*Syslog Message*::
Creating a common Snapshot copy for source volume "%s" and destination volume "%s" with relationship UUID "%s" has failed due to the following reason: "%s". Elapsed time since the latest successful common Snapshot copy is %s.
*Parameters*::

*dstpath* (STRING): Path name of the destination volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*relationship_id* (STRING): Relationship UUID.
*error_msg* (STRING): Error that prevented the common Snapshot copy from being created.
