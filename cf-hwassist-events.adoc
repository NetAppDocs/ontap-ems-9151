(None).
*Syslog Message*::
The system automatically chose %s as the local hardware-assist IP address.
*Parameters*::
*defaultip* (STRING): Default hardware-wassist IP address chosen to receive hardware assist alerts.

== cf.hwassist.DefaultEnabled
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system automatically enables the hardware-assist takeover feature. With hardware-assisted takeover, certain failures, such as watchdog reset, POST error, and so on, trigger hardware-assisted takeover through hardware components such as Remote LAN Module (RLM) or Service Processor (SP).
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Hardware-assisted takeover feature is enabled on this system. The partner can take over this node faster during certain failures.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.hwassist.DefaultPrtnrAddr
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the hardware-assist partner address is not configured and the system automatically picked a partner IP address for the hardware-assisted takeover feature. If a partner node has multiple node management IP addresses, a different partner node management IP address can optionally be set by using the "storage failover modify -hwassist-partner-ip" command. Note: the automatically configured IP address cannot be modified on some platforms.
*Corrective Action*::

The system automatically chose %s as the hardware-assisted takeover partner address.
*Parameters*::
*defaultip* (STRING): Default hardware-assist partner IP address chosen to send hardware-assisted takeover alerts.

== cf.hwassist.DefaultPrtnrPort
*Severity*::
NOTICE

A different partner port number can optionally be set by using the "storage failover modify -hwassist-partner-port" command. Note: the default port number cannot be modified on some platforms.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
The system set the default hardware-assist partner port number to %d.
*Parameters*::
*defaultport* (INT): Default hardware-assist partner port number.

== cf.hwassist.missedKeepAlive
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the HW-assisted takeover process on this node has not received keep-alive messages from its HA partner.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "storage failover hwassist show" command to verify the status of the HW-assisted takeover feature. If the 'Keep Alive Status' field reports "healthy", it is functional. If the "storage failover hwassist show" command "Keep Alive Status" field reports "did not receive hwassist keep alive alerts from partner" and the "storage failover hwassist stats show" command shows the value of the "ID_mismatch" is incrementing, disable the service-processor (SP or BMC) IPv4 or IPv6 network interfaces and then reenable them, as stated below. Use the "system service-processor network show" command to display the current network configuration. Note whether the IPv4 or IPv6 address-family is enabled. You need this information in the next steps. Perform the following on each node that has an issue: Disable the interface for an address-family by using the "sp network modify -node {name} -address-family {IPv4|IPv6} -enable false" command. Then, reenable the interface for an address-family by setting "-enable true" via the above command.
*Syslog Message*::

== cf.hwassist.notifyCfgFailed
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::

*Corrective Action*::
Use the ""system node service-processor show"" command to check whether the SP is online. The SP must be online to update the hardware-assist configuration. If the SP is operational and online, use the ""system node service-processor reboot-sp"" command to reboot the SP.If the message persists, contact NetApp technical support.

== cf.hwassist.socInitFailed
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when hwassist thread fails to create socket.
*Corrective Action*::

*Syslog Message*::
hw_assist: Fail to create socket.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.hwassist.startThrottle
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the hardware assist subsystem thread detects that it is receiving hardware assist alerts at a rate higher than the maximum configurable rate and has temporarily stopped listening for hardware assist alerts. This can be an indication that another client is configured to send SNMP traps to the hardware assist trap IP address and port. If the partner node fails while listening for hardware assist alerts is disabled, detection of the partner failure can take slightly longer as loss of heartbeat from the partner or other non-hardware-assisted mechanism is instead needed to detect the failure. Subsequent receipt of the cf.hwassist.stopThrottle message indicates the hardware assist thread is again listening for hardware assist alerts.
*Corrective Action*::
Check whether some other client is configured to send SNMP alerts to the IP address and port on which hardware assist is configured. You can obtain the IP address using the ""storage failover hwassist show"" command. If this is the case, direct those SNMP alerts to the correct IP address and port. If not, contact NetApp technical support to further diagnose the issue.
*Syslog Message*::
hw_assist: Received %llu hw_assist alerts in %llu secs. Throttling alerts for %llu secs.
*Parameters*::
*num_of_traps* (LONGINT): Number of traps received.
*time_interval* (LONGINT): Time window in which the traps were received.
*throttle_time* (LONGINT): Time for which throttle will happen.

== cf.hwassist.stopThrottle
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a node has stopped throttling hardware assist alerts from the partner. This indicates the hardware assist thread has restarted listening for hardware assist alerts subsequent to the receipt of the cf.hwassist.startThrottle event.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor hw_assist: Shutting off throttle for hw_assist alerts from partner(%s).
*Parameters*::
*partnerName* (STRING): Partner's name.

== cf.hwassist.takeoverTrapRecv
