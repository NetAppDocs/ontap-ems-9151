*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Block number mismatch on WRITE VERIFY: Disk %s, expected_dbn = %u, stored_dbn = %u, expected_vbn = %llu, stored_vbn = %llu, Volume %s, FileId %d, Block #%llu.
*Parameters*::
*diskName* (STRING): Name of the device.
*expected_dbn* (INT): Expected physical disk block number.
*stored_dbn* (INT): Physical disk block number stored in the checksum entry.
*expected_vbn* (LONGINT): Expected volume block number.
*stored_vbn* (LONGINT): Volume block number stored in the checksum entry.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
