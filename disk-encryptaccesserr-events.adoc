== disk.encryptAccessErr
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a disk reports a data protection error, and ONTAP(R) cannot restore permission to access the data through storage encryption methods.
*Corrective Action*::
If the disk is known to be an encrypting disk, then ONTAP might not have the correct storage encryption passphrase for this device. If possible, import the proper passphrase. If the passphrase cannot be recovered, or if the disk is not an encrypting disk, then all data on the disk is permanently inaccessible. You can return an encrypting disk to service as a spare through the use of the 'disk encrypt sanitize' command. If the device cannot be recovered, then it must be removed from the system.
*Syslog Message*::
Unable to restore data access on encrypting disk %s; status %s (0x%x).
*Parameters*::
*diskName* (STRING): Name of the disk.
*status_string* (STRING): Status code description.
*status* (INT): Status code from the SCSI driver.
