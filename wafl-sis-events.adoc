== wafl.sis.clone.unlock.snapshot
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This event is issued when the volume options are set such that the autodelete destroy policy is allowed to destroy backing snapshots for sis clones. The snapshot autodelete destroy policy is used as a last resort to recover space in a thin provisioned aggregate. The disruptive effect of destroying sis clone backing snapshots should be understood when setting this policy.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Unlocked sis clone backing snapshot in volume %s. Clone files based on snapshot (%d, %d) might become inconsistent.
*Parameters*::
*name* (STRING): The volume name
*snapid* (INT): Snapshot(tm) copy identifier.
*cp_cnt* (INT): The CP(Consistency Point) count. The (snapid, cp_count) pair uniquely identifies a Snapshot copy.
