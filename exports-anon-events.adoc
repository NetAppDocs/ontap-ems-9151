== exports.anon.noCredForId
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when we cannot get UNIX credentials for a user id when evaluating the "-anon" portion of an export-policy rule.
*Corrective Action*::
If "-anon" is a UID, ensure that a valid UID exists on the configured name servers. If "-anon" is a username, ensure that a mapping exists between the username and the UID on the configured name servers and the resulting UID is also present.
*Syslog Message*::
Cannot retrieve credentials for UID "%u" present in the "-anon" entry for the export-policy rule for Vserver "%d".
*Parameters*::
*anonId* (INT): UNIX UID for which we cannot acquire credentials.
*vserver* (INT): Identifier of the Vserver owning the export-policy.
