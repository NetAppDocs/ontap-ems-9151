== sasmon.adapter.phy.disable
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::

*Corrective Action*::
If the HBA is in use, check the cabling. If it is connected to the disk shelves, check the seating of the IOM (I/O module) cards. If that does not fix the problem, contact NetApp technical support.

*Parameters*::
