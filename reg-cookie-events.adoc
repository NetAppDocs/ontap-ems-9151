== reg.cookie.null
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when allocation of cookies for traversing all keys under a prefix fails. An EFAULT error indicates that the cause is an empty registry tree. An ENOTSUPP error indicates that the prefix entered might not be supported on a vFiler unit. An ENOMEM error indicates that the system is running low on memory.
*Corrective Action*::
For an EFAULT error, check the prefix for spelling errors. For an ENOTSUPP error, try running the command on physical system, rather than a virtual system. For an ENOMEM error, close all applications that are consuming memory, as needed. If the problem persists,contact NetApp technical support
