== replication.qtree.dst.disk.error
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the replication destination engine receives blocks with disk errors from the source for the first time in a transfer and continues with replication.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
SnapMirror: transfer from %s:%s to %s:%s: Source volume has disk errors. Continuing with replication. See /etc/log/snapmirror for inconsistency details.
*Parameters*::
*src_filer* (STRING): Source filer of this replication transfer.
*src_path* (STRING): Source path of this replication transfer.
*dst_filer* (STRING): Destination filer of this replication transfer.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination path of this replication transfer.

== replication.qtree.dst.disk.error.abort
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the replication destination engine receives blocks with disk errors from the source and aborts because of user-set options.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
SnapMirror: transfer from %s:%s to %s:%s: Source volume has disk errors. (source fid:%u,source fbn:%u,source snapid:%u). Aborting transfer.
*Parameters*::
*src_filer* (STRING): Source filer of this replication transfer.
*src_path* (STRING): Source path of this replication transfer.
*dst_filer* (STRING): Destination filer of this replication transfer.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination path of this replication transfer.
*sfileid* (INT): Identifying number for the suspect file
*sfbn* (INT): File block number in which the disk error was found.
*ssnapid* (INT): Incremental Snapshot(tm) copy of the source from which this file came.

== replication.qtree.dst.disk.error.summary
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the replication involving blocks with disk errors happens on the replication destination.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
SnapMirror: transfer from %s:%s to %s:%s: Source volume has disk errors. %u blocks out of %u blocks replicated are inconsistent. See /etc/log/snapmirror for inconsistency details.
*Parameters*::
*src_filer* (STRING): Source filer of this replication transfer.
*src_path* (STRING): Source path of this replication transfer.
*dst_filer* (STRING): Destination filer of this replication transfer.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination path of this replication transfer.
*total_bad_blks* (INT): Total number of blocks with disk errors received.
*total_blks* (INT): Total number of blocks received.

== replication.qtree.dst.inconsistent.acl
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the replication destination engine receives an Access Control List (ACL) with disk errors from the source.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
SnapMirror: transfer from %s:%s to %s:%s: Source volume has disk errors. (source acl fid:%u,source snapid:%u). Aborting transfer.
*Parameters*::
*src_filer* (STRING): Source filer of this replication transfer.
*src_path* (STRING): Source path of this replication transfer.
*dst_filer* (STRING): Destination filer of this replication transfer.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination path of this replication transfer.
*sfileid* (INT): Identifying number for the suspect ACL.
*snapid* (INT): Incremental Snapshot(tm) copy of the source from which this ACL came.

== replication.qtree.dst.inconsistent.symlink
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the replication destination engine receives a symbolic link with disk errors from the source.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
SnapMirror: transfer from %s:%s to %s:%s: Source volume has disk errors. (source symlink fid:%u,source snapid:%u). Aborting transfer.
*Parameters*::
*src_filer* (STRING): Source filer of this replication transfer.
*src_path* (STRING): Source path of this replication transfer.
*dst_filer* (STRING): Destination filer of this replication transfer.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination path of this replication transfer.
*sfileid* (INT): Identifying number for the suspect symbolic link.
*snapid* (INT): Incremental Snapshot(tm) copy of the source from which this symbolic link came.
