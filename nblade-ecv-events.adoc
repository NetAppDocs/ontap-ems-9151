== nblade.ecv.not.ready
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when ONTAP(R) software uses a default Effective Cluster Version (ECV) before the actual ECV has been conclusively determined. Some features might not work as expected until ONTAP can select the correct ECV.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Default ECV %s has been used. The ECV value '%d' does not reflect the cluster's true ECV status.
*Parameters*::
*ecv_variable_name* (STRING): Name of the ECV value being used.
*ecv_variable_value* (INT): ECV value being used.
