This message does not indicate anything abnormal or problematic.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Found converted directories in %s %s%s%s%s that require their entry's inode-to-parent (i2p) information updated. Starting the i2p initialization scanner to update the entries in the converted directories. This is normal.

== wafl.iron.pending.delete.vvol
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This wafliron event indicates that a volume is awaiting deletion and cannot be ironed/onlined. It's deletion also cannot be canceled while iron is running, so its retention time may need to be extended in order to keep the volume.
*Corrective Action*::
If you do not want the volume to be deleted while iron is running, check the retention time and consider extending it.
*Syslog Message*::
Flexible volume %s%s%s on aggregate %s is awaiting deletion. Wafliron cannot run on such volumes.
*Parameters*::
*volname* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Unique identifier of the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.
*aggrname* (STRING): Aggregate name.

== wafl.iron.ral.exception
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when wafliron is loading an inode that has a remote entry, but the corresponding remote volume is not reachable.
*Corrective Action*::
Inspect the status of the FlexGroup remote volume, which might be down due to network errors, cluster node failures, or corruption in one or more of its constituent aggregates. Also check the health and connectivity of all nodes that are hosting these aggregates.
*Syslog Message*::
Wafliron could not load inode "%d" on volume "%s" because the remote volume is not accessible.
*Parameters*::
*inode* (INT): Inode that could not be loaded.
*volume* (STRING): Volume being inspected by wafliron.

== wafl.iron.ral.inode.loaded
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when wafliron succeeds in loading an inode in a FlexGroup origin volume that was not reachable earlier.

*Syslog Message*::
After several retries, wafliron has processed inode "%d" in volume "%s".
*Parameters*::
*inode* (INT): Inode loaded after retries.
*volume* (STRING): Volume being inspected by wafliron.

This message occurs during wafliron volume initialization, indicating that volumes with read-only qtrees might not be checked.
*Corrective Action*::
Use either the "-f" or the "-include-mirrors" option to run wafliron on SnapMirror(R) destination volumes.
*Syslog Message*::
%s%s%s: Volumes containing readonly qtrees require additional command options to be checked using wafliron
*Parameters*::
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the volume.

== wafl.iron.rebuild.dir.volful
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs while running wafliron, when there might not be enough free space on the volume to rebuild a damaged directory.
*Corrective Action*::
Increase the size of the volume or free space on the aggregate that contains the volume.

== wafl.iron.salvaged.rootdir
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when wafliron detects a corrupted rootdir in an index-dir-enabled volume and re-creates it with all valid entries in the rootdir. The old corrupted rootdir has been converted into a regular file and linked to the /lost+found directory.
*Corrective Action*::
Remove the file from the /lost+found directory.
*Syslog Message*::
Rootdir of volume %s has been corrected and contains all valid names. The contents of the old rootdir have been copied to file i#%d.* in the /lost+found directory.
*Parameters*::

== wafl.iron.slow
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a "wafliron start" or a "wafliron show" command is issued and the aggregate that hosts wafliron status files for the aggregate on which wafliron is running contains only one data disk.
*Corrective Action*::
1.Use the "-status-files-vserver" and "-status-files-volume" parameters of the "aggr wafliron start" command to host status files on a non-root aggregate volume, that has an adequate number of data disks that can accommodate the extra workload. 2.Add more disks to the root aggregate using "aggr add" command.
*Syslog Message*::
Aggregate %s: wafliron performance will be significantly impacted because aggregate %s contains only one data disk. Running wafliron with status files hosted on a non-root aggregate volume that has an adequate number of data disks, or adding more disks to the root aggregate is recommended.
