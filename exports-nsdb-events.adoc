== exports.nsdb.anonNameToId
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a user string cannot be mapped to a user id when evaluating the "-anon" portion of an export-policy rule.
*Corrective Action*::
If the "-anon" value is a name, ensure that a mapping from that name to a UID exists in the configured name services. For both a name and a UID entry in "-anon", ensure that the resulting UID exists in the configured name services.
*Syslog Message*::
Cannot retrieve UID for UNIX username "%s" present in the "-anon" entry for the export-policy rule for Vserver "%d".
*Parameters*::
*anon* (STRING): Anonymous string that cannot be mapped to a user id.
*vserver* (INT): Name of the Vserver owning the export-policy.
