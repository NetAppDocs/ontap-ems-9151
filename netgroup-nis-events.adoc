== netgroup.nis.byhost.decode
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the netgroup.byhost remote procedure call to the Network Information Service (NIS) server returns a response that cannot be decoded.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the netgroup byhost database on the NIS server for lines that have more than 1024 characters.
*Syslog Message*::
NIS server returned an undecodable response for Vserver "%s" during lookup for netgroup "%s".
*Parameters*::
*vserver* (STRING): Name of the Vserver on which the problem is occurring.
*netgroup* (STRING): Name of the netgroup for the lookup request.

== netgroup.nis.byhost.missing
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when the netgroup.byhost map is not configured on the Network Information Service (NIS) server and NIS is configured as a ns-switch source for the Vserver. Enabling netgroup.byhost enables mount operations to succeed faster when the netgroup size is large.
*Corrective Action*::
Consider configuring the netgroup.byhost map on the NIS server to gain better performance with netgroups.
*Syslog Message*::
NIS server missing netgroup.byhost map for Vserver "%s" during lookup for netgroup "%s".
*Parameters*::
*vserver* (STRING): Name of the Vserver on which the problem is occurring.
*netgroup* (STRING): Name of the netgroup for the lookup request.

== netgroup.nis.config
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a netgroup lookup request finds that Network Information Service (NIS) is specified as a ns-switch source, but NIS is not configured for the Vserver. Netgroup lookups using NIS will not function.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the ns-switch sources configured for the netgroup database using "vserver services name-service ns-switch show" and the NIS configuration for the Vserver using "nis-domain show". Either remove NIS as a ns-switch source, or configure NIS.
*Syslog Message*::
NIS configuration issues found for Vserver "%s" during lookup for netgroup "%s".
*Parameters*::
*vserver* (STRING): Name of the Vserver on which the problem is occurring.
*netgroup* (STRING): Name of the netgroup for the lookup request.
