== raid.fdr.failed.ok
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when we detect an entry in the failed disk registry, and have forcibly failed the disk.
*Corrective Action*::
Please make sure that the event message raid.disk.unload.done or raid.carrier.remove has been seen in the log. And then replace the carrier containing the failed disk. If the disk is contained in a single-disk carrier, raid.disk.unload.done will be issued immediately. Otherwise, wait for raid.carrier.remove which indicates the carrier has been fully prepared for removal.
*Syslog Message*::
%s successfully deleted from spare pool
*Parameters*::
*disk_info* (STRING): Formatted information of the disk object
*shelf* (STRING): Shelf identifier where the disk is located
*bay* (STRING): Disk bay within the shelf where disk is located
*vendor* (STRING): Name of the vendor of the disk
*model* (STRING): Model string of the disk drive
*firmware_revision* (STRING): Firmware revision number of the disk
*serialno* (STRING): Serial number of the disk
*disk_type* (INT): Type of disk drive
*disk_rpm* (STRING): Rotational speed of disk in RPM
*carrier* (STRING): Unique ID of the carrier in which the disk is installed.
*site* (STRING): For a MetroCluster(tm) configuration, indicates the site {Local|Remote} where the disk is located. For non-MetroCluster configurations, site is 'Local'.

== raid.fdr.full
*Severity*::
ERROR

This message occurs when we determine that the failed disk registry is full and we must eliminate an existing disk entry.
*Corrective Action*::
Please make sure that the event message raid.disk.unload.done or raid.carrier.remove has been seen in the log. And then replace the carrier containing the failed disk. If the disk is contained in a single-disk carrier, raid.disk.unload.done will be issued immediately. Otherwise, wait for raid.carrier.remove which indicates the carrier has been fully prepared for removal.
*Syslog Message*::
