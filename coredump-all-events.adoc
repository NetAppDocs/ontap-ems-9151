*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
All disks available to coredump already contain unsaved cores.
*Corrective Action*::
There are three choices. First, add more disks to the system. Second, delete any unsaved cores by running "savecore -k". Third, save any unsaved cores by running "savecore". It may be necessary to run "savecore -f" to save the cores, if previous attempts to save these cores have failed.
