== cf.fm.cpuUtilDuringTOAndGB
*Deprecated*::
Deprecated as of version 9.0.
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs at the start of a takeover, end of a successful takeover, start of a CFO giveback, and completion of an SFO giveback. It records the maximum, minimum, and average CPU and disk utilization on the node executing the takeover or giveback.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
CPU and disk utilization during the %d seconds %s: cpu_util_high: %lld; cpu_util_low: %lld; cpu_util_avg: %lld; disk_util_high: %lld; disk_util_low: %lld; disk_util_avg: %lld
*Parameters*::
*window_sz* (INT): Duration, in seconds, over which CPU and disk utilization are tracked.
*when* (STRING): Event during which CPU and disk utilization are tracked.

*disk_util_low* (LONGINT): Minimum disk utilization.
*disk_util_avg* (LONGINT): Average disk utilization.

== cf.fm.discardNvram
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This event is issued when we discover that the partner has previously taken us over, forcing us to invalidate our own nvram contents. This is a normal condition, subsequent to a takeover/giveback.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: node was previously taken over, nvram may be discarded
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.diskInventoryOff
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system discovers that disk inventory gathering has been disabled. During normal operation, the high-availability (HA) nodes transmit their disk inventory data at regular intervals. This is intended to prevent a situation in which loop connectivity problems are unnoticed until a takeover event occurs. If this event occurs, contact NetApp technical support.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "sysconfig" and "storage" nodeshell commands to determine whether there are problems with the loop, adapter, or shelf. Resolve those problems.
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: HA disk inventory disabled.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.diskRelease
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued when we're using a debug build and failover monitor reservations are released.
*Corrective Action*::
n/a
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: released disk reservations.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.diskReleaseFail
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the release of a reservation on a disk fails in preparation for a giveback event. The error indicates that a disk is not ready, that it failed, or that it does not exist. If the reservation is detected by the partner node, it will reboot.
*Corrective Action*::
Look for the cf.disk.releaseFailed event in the EMS log to find the name of the disk where the reservation could not be released. Follow the corrective action described in the cf.disk.releaseFailed event to address any problems with the disk.
*Syslog Message*::
Could not release disk reservations of at least one disk.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.duplicateId
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the local node system identifier is the same as the partner's. This could happen if the HA-Interconnect is configured for loopback in maintenance mode systems or if the system was not properly configured. The local node will halt in this case and the partner node will do a takeover of the local node resources, provided takeover is enabled.
*Corrective Action*::
If this message occurs only while the system is configured in maintenance mode, it can be ignored as HA-interconnect loopback tests send a message with a node's own system identifier to itself. If this message occurs while a system is not in maintenance mode, check if the HA-interconnect cables are properly connected. If cabling is correct, contact NetApp technical support for assistance.
*Syslog Message*::
Partner ID %u is the same as that of this node. This node will halt and the partner will perform a takeover, if takeover is enabled.
*Parameters*::
*id* (INT): System ID.

(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: giveback of previous takeover complete
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.earlyTakeoverFailed
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when an error during early takeover prevents the node from booting into takeover mode. The node instead boots up without taking over its partner and also releases its partner resources, allowing the partner node to boot up. Note: Early takeover occurs when a node boots up after rebooting while in takeover mode.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the EMS log for the cf.rsrc.takeoverFail error or other errors indicating why the node could not boot into takeover mode.
*Syslog Message*::
Early takeover failed; node will boot without taking over partner node. Partner resources released, allowing partner node to boot.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.takeoverDetectionSeconds.Default
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the takeover detection time is set to a value less than the DEFAULT_FIRMWARE_TIMEOUTS setting. This can result in false takeovers and takeovers without diagnostic core dumps.
*Corrective Action*::
Modify the takeover detection time to the recommended value by using the "storage failover modify -detection-time" command.
*Syslog Message*::
Takeover detection time is set to %d seconds, which is below the recommended value of %d seconds. False takeovers and takeovers without diagnostic core dumps might occur.
*Parameters*::
*SECONDS* (INT): Value that the takeover detection time is set to.
*FIRMWARE_TIMEOUT_DEF* (INT): Recommended value.

== cf.fm.takeoverDetectionSeconds.Kernel
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the takeover detection time is set to a value less than the KERNEL_TIMEOUT setting (as specified by the "sk.process.timeout.override" option). This can result in takeovers without accompanying diagnostic core dumps of the taken over node.
*Corrective Action*::
Set the takeover detection time to the recommended value by using the "storage failover modify -detection-time" command.
*Syslog Message*::
Takeover detection time is set to %d seconds, which is below %d (= sk.process.timeout.override + 5) seconds. Takeovers without diagnostic core dumps might occur.
*Parameters*::
*SECONDS* (INT): Value that the takeover detection time is set to.
*KERNEL_TIMEOUT* (INT): Minimum value that should be used.

== cf.fm.takeoverDuration
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when a takeover is completed successfully.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: takeover duration time is %llu seconds.
*Parameters*::
*takeover_duration* (LONGINT): Takeover duration time.

== cf.fm.takeoverFailed
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the failover monitor determines that a takeover has failed. The reason code is a string that describes the reason for the failure. Any data LIFs that were migrated as part of the takeover operation are not automatically reverted.
*Corrective Action*::
Resolve the issue based on the reason logged in the message.
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: takeover failed '%s'
*Parameters*::
*reason* (STRING): Internal reason code for the failure.
*token* (STRING): Unique token that identifies a failover instance.
*partner_node_uuid* (STRING): UUID of the partner node.

== cf.fm.takeoverStarted
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the failover monitor initiates a takeover.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: takeover started
*Parameters*::
*token* (STRING): Unique token that identifies a failover instance.
*partner_node_uuid* (STRING): UUID of the partner node.

== cf.fm.timeMasterStatus
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is when we determine our status as time master or slave.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Acting as time %s
*Parameters*::
*masterOrSlave* (STRING): Master or Slave

== cf.fm.TODetectionSecs.reset
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when the current setting of takeover detection time is shorter than the minimum takeover detection time allowed by this version of Data ONTAP(R). This can result in false takeovers or takeovers without diagnostic core dumps. Data ONTAP resets the takeover detection time to the new minimum.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Takeover detection time was set to %d seconds, shorter than the minimum allowed. Reset the detection time to a new minimum of %d seconds.
*Parameters*::
*SECONDS* (INT): Current takeover detection seconds.
*FIRMWARE_TIMEOUT_DEF* (INT): New default takeover detection seconds.

== cf.fm.transitTimeChange
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when you set the takeover or giveback transit timeout to a value other than the default value. During takeover or giveback, if the timeout is exceeded by a subsystem during the takeover/giveback processing, a panic occurs. If the timeout is set too high, longer client outages might occur instead of aborting the takeover/giveback.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
(None).
*Parameters*::
*SECONDS* (INT): Transit timeout value (in seconds).
*DEFAULT_VAL* (INT): Default transit timeout value (in seconds).

== cf.fm.undoFailedTakeover
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This event is issued when we initiate an undo of a failed takeover.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: initiate giveback due to failed takeover
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.unexpectedPartner
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the HA mode is set to "non_ha" but the HA mode was set to "ha" previously. This is not an error, but indicates a possible misconfiguration of the system.
*Corrective Action*::
Determine whether the HA mode should be set to "ha", and if so, set it.
*Syslog Message*::
Warning: HA mode is set to "non_ha" but the node once had a storage failover partner.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== cf.fm.versionMismatch
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This event occurs when a version mismatch is detected during internode initialization. Each node transmits its version information to its partner. If a mismatch is detected, the High Availability (HA) takeover capability is disabled.
*Corrective Action*::
Boot both nodes on the same release.
*Syslog Message*::
Failover monitor: %s version mismatch detected: %d/%d
*Parameters*::
*subsystem* (STRING): The name of the versioned subsystem
*myVersion* (INT): My version
*partnerVersion* (INT): The partner's version

== cf.fm.waitBeforeWFG
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when a system waits, during boot, for a module to come up before declaring itself ready for giveback. Examples include waiting for the NVRAM battery to be charged.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
