== callhome.dbs.svcap.full
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when the Distributed Block Store (DBS) detects a service (Slice or Block) that has completely consumed its capacity. The DBS is responsible for managing the data that backs the FlexVols(R). The data for this service is now read-only. If your system is configured to do so, it generates and transmits an AutoSupport (or 'call home') message to NetApp technical support and to the configured destinations. Successful delivery of an AutoSupport message significantly improves problem determination and resolution.
*Corrective Action*::
Evaluate the available capacity of this service relative to its usage. If some capacity is currently unavailable due to drives or nodes being offline, attempt the repairs needed to bring them online. Free storage used by FlexVols by deleting unneeded volumes. If the services's available capacity appears inconsistent with the calculated expected capacity, then contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Call home for %s, service %u, node %u/%s, drives %s.
*Parameters*::
*subject* (STRING): AutoSupport subject or title for this event.
*serviceID* (INT): Service ID that identifies the associated cluster service.
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Node UUID of the associated node. It will be zeroes if there is no associated node.
*cfDriveIDs* (STRING): List of the drive IDs associated with the fault. The list might be empty.
*cfDriveUuids* (STRING): List of the drive UUIDs associated with the fault. The list might be empty.
*cfType* (STRING): DBS cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): DBS cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*collectAsupNodes* (STRING): List of the node universal unique identifiers (UUIDs) from which AutoSupport messages should be collected.
*cfDetails* (STRING): Description of the cluster fault, including context details.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): DBS cluster fault externalSource label created by the CreateClusterFault API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.

== callhome.dbs.svcap.near.full
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the Distributed Block Store (DBS) detects a service (Slice or Block) that has consumed nearly all of its capacity. The DBS is responsible for managing the data that backs the FlexVols(R). If your system is configured to do so, it generates and transmits an AutoSupport (or 'call home') message to NetApp technical support and to the configured destinations. Successful delivery of an AutoSupport message significantly improves problem determination and resolution.
*Corrective Action*::
Evaluate the available capacity of this service relative to its usage. If some capacity is currently unavailable due to drives or nodes being offline, attempt the repairs needed to bring them online. Free storage used by FlexVols by deleting unneeded volumes.
*Syslog Message*::
Call home for %s, service %u, node %u/%s, drives %s.

*cfDetails* (STRING): Description of the cluster fault, including context details.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): DBS cluster fault externalSource label created by the CreateClusterFault API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.
*skip_callhome* (INT): If 1, then the ASUP call home was not executed for this event. Call home is only done for newly reported faults (see cfStatus).

== callhome.dbs.volumes.offline
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when the Distributed Block Store (DBS) detects that one or more volumes in the storage cluster are offline. For the volumes listed, both copies of volume slice data are unavailable. The volumes are degraded and the primary slice service becomes unresponsive, as detected by the Cluster Master. The VolumesDegraded fault will also be present. The DBS is responsible for managing the data that backs the FlexVols(R). If your system is configured to do so, it generates and transmits an AutoSupport (or 'call home') message to NetApp technical support and to the configured destinations. Successful delivery of an AutoSupport message significantly improves problem determination and resolution.
*Corrective Action*::
Check for network connectivity issues and hardware errors. There should be other faults if specific hardware components have failed. Attempt to resolve these issues. The fault will clear when the primary slice service is responsive. Contact Support if there are no associated hardware faults and this fault persists long enough to affect client applications.
*Syslog Message*::
Call home for %s. One or more DBS volumes offline.
*Parameters*::
*subject* (STRING): AutoSupport subject or title for this event.
*cfType* (STRING): DBS cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): DBS cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*collectAsupNodes* (STRING): List of the node universal unique identifiers (UUIDs) from which AutoSupport messages should be collected.
*cfDetails* (STRING): Description of the cluster fault, including context details.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): DBS cluster fault externalSource label created by the CreateClusterFault API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.
*skip_callhome* (INT): If 1, then the ASUP call home was not executed for this event. Call home is only done for newly reported faults (see cfStatus).
