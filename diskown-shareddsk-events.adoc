*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a disk is shared by multiple nodes in a non-HA or stand-alone configuration.

*Corrective Action*::
Refer to the High-Availability Configuration Guide.
*Syslog Message*::
Either some local disks have partitions that are not owned by the local node, or the local node owns partitions on non-local disks.
*Parameters*::
(None).
