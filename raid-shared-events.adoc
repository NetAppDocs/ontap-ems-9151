== raid.shared.disk.awaiting.done
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when a node receives an indication from its HA partner node that a shared disk is undergoing a change in state and the partner is waiting for the local node to complete a shared state transition.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Received shared disk awaiting done %s, state %s, substate 0x%lX, partner state %s, partner substate 0x%lX, partner dblade ID %s host type %d add details %s
*Parameters*::
*disk_info* (STRING): Formatted information of the shared disk.
*local_state* (STRING): State of the shared disk on the local node.
*local_substate* (LONGINTHEX): Sub-state of the shared disk on the local node.
*partner_state* (STRING): State of the shared disk on the partner node.
*partner_substate* (LONGINTHEX): Sub-state of the shared disk on the partner node.
*received_ack* (STRING): Dblade ID of node sending await done ack.
*host_type* (INT): Type of host node sending await done ack.
*add_details* (STRING): Additional details of the awaiting done event.
*shelf* (STRING): Shelf identifier where the disk is located.
*bay* (STRING): Disk bay within the shelf where the disk is located.
*vendor* (STRING): Name of the disk vendor.
*model* (STRING): Model string of the disk.
*firmware_revision* (STRING): Disk firmware revision number.
*serialno* (STRING): Serial number of the disk.
*disk_type* (INT): Type of disk.
*disk_rpm* (STRING): Rotational speed of the disk, in RPM.
*carrier* (STRING): Unique ID of the carrier in which the disk is installed.
*site* (STRING): For a MetroCluster(tm) configuration, indicates the site {Local|Remote} where the disk is located. For non-MetroCluster configurations, site is 'Local'.

== raid.shared.disk.exchange
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when a node receives an indication from its HA partner node that a shared disk is undergoing a change in state (e.g., disk is failing, going offline, or is getting unfailed). Accompanying EMS messages will indicate if any corrective action is required.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Received shared disk state exchange %s, event %s, state %s, substate 0x%lX, partner state %s, partner substate 0x%lX, failure reason %s, sick reason %s, offline reason %s, online reason %s, partner dblade ID %s, host %d %s
*Parameters*::
*disk_info* (STRING): Formatted information of the shared disk.
*event* (STRING): Describes the event which caused the partner to send this state exchange message. If this is a periodic exchange instead of an event triggered exchange, event is NONE.
*local_state* (STRING): State of the shared disk on the local node.
*local_substate* (LONGINTHEX): Sub-state of the shared disk on the local node.
*partner_state* (STRING): State of the shared disk on the partner node.
*partner_substate* (LONGINTHEX): Sub-state of the shared disk on the partner node.
*failure_reason* (STRING): Describes the error leading to the partner node failing the shared disk.
*sick_reason* (STRING): Describes the error leading to the partner node prefailing the shared disk.
*offline_reason* (STRING): Describes the reason the partner node is offlining the shared disk.
*online_reason* (STRING): Describes the reason the partner node is onlining the shared disk.
*recv_reply* (STRING): Describes the dblade ID of a partner node that sent a reply.
*host_type* (INT): Type of host sending the reply.
*add_details* (STRING): Additional partner node details of the shared disk state exchange.
*timestamp* (INT): Timestamp of the last on-disk state change.
*shelf* (STRING): Shelf identifier where the disk is located.
*bay* (STRING): Disk bay within the shelf where the disk is located.
*vendor* (STRING): Name of the disk vendor.
*model* (STRING): Model string of the disk.
*firmware_revision* (STRING): Disk firmware revision number.
*serialno* (STRING): Serial number of the disk.
*disk_type* (INT): Type of disk.
*disk_rpm* (STRING): Rotational speed of the disk, in RPM.
*carrier* (STRING): Unique ID of the carrier in which the disk is installed.
*site* (STRING): For a MetroCluster(tm) configuration, indicates the site {Local|Remote} where the disk is located. For non-MetroCluster configurations, site is 'Local'.
