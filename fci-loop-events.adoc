ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the Fibre Channel loop generates too many loop initialization events. This can be a sign of unstable hardware.
*Corrective Action*::
If the adapter is in use check cabling, and if it is connected to disk shelves check the seating of the LRC/ESH cards and disks. If this does not resolve the issue, contact NetApp technical support for assistance in diagnosing a Fibre Channel issue.
*Syslog Message*::
Fibre Channel adapter %s has a loop stability problem. %d loop-initialization events seen in %d seconds.
*Parameters*::
*adapterName* (STRING): Name of the associated Fibre Channel host bus adapter.
*numLips* (INT): Number of loop-initialization events that occurred.
*numSeconds* (INT): Time interval that these loop-initialization events were seen.
