== raid.vol.volinfo.mismatch
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when a mismatch is detected for both copies of the volinfo block during an attempt to mount a SyncMirror aggregate. Data corruption is suspected. The aggregate cannot be mounted. The volinfo block is the superblock in the WAFL(R) file system. Two copies of the volinfo block are stored in blocks 1 and 2 of the file system. The two copies are the same except when there is an unclean shutdown of the file system, for example, after a panic. In a SyncMirror aggregate, all used blocks are mirrored in two plexes. Volinfo blocks are written so that either both copies of block 1 are the same in two plexes, or both copies of block 2 are the same in two plexes at any point in time. In an unexpected case when that is not true, it is not possible to determine which copy of the volinfo block points to a consistent state of the file system. The message describes a mismatch for only one copy of the volinfo block. A pair of messages is always issued to describe the mismatch for both copies of the volinfo block, because a mismatch for only one copy is not an unusual event.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
%s %s%s: volinfo blocks (VBN %llu) do not match in two plexes. %s: disk %s, magic 0x%x, CP count %d, checksum %u; %s: disk %s, magic 0x%x, CP count %d, checksum %u.
*Parameters*::
*vol_type* (STRING): Volume type.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the aggregate.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.
*vbn* (LONGINT): Volume block number of the volinfo block (1 or 2).
*plex1* (STRING): First plex name.
*disk1* (STRING): Name of the disk in the first plex.
*magic1* (INT): Identifier of the block type in the first plex. It should be 0xdab8fbab for the volinfo block.
*CP_count1* (INT): Consistency point count in the first plex.
*checksum1* (INT): Block checksum in the first plex.
*plex2* (STRING): Second plex name.
*disk2* (STRING): Name of the disk in the second plex.
