*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when SnapVault(R) creates a backup Snapshot(tm) copy for a given backup schedule.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
A backup Snapshot copy was created on volume %s by backup schedule %s (%d of %d allocated Snapshot copies consumed).
*Parameters*::
*vol_name* (STRING): Name of the SnapVault secondary volume on which the backup Snapshot copy is created.
*target_name* (STRING): Base name of the backup schedule for which the given backup Snapshot copy is created.
*snap_cnt* (INT): Total number of backup Snapshot copies created for the given backup schedule.
*alloc_cnt* (INT): Total number of backup Snapshot copies allocated for the given backup schedule.

== snapvault.dst.bliDataRepaired
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message is issued when SnapVault may have repaired data that had previously been made incorrect/incomplete by Bug #137685 which has now been fixed. Under some conditions this message may be issued when, in fact, the data was not previously incorrect or incomplete. Under some conditions, the SnapVault code cannot determine whether the previous version of the data was correct or not, but it does know that after the current transfer completes that the data is correct. This message will only be issued if the hidden snapvault option, repair_bug137685_stats is enabled.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Data ONTAP changed data in %d data chunk(s) in %s which may have been missing or incorrect.
*Parameters*::
*chunks_repaired* (INT): The number of of chunks which may have been repaired. Up to 2MB of data may be sent in a chunk in the QSM/SnapVault data format. This count is incremented for each chunk in which one or more 4K blocks may have been repaired.
*dst_path* (STRING): Destination qtree path.

== snapvault.dst.bliWarning
*Severity*::

== snapvault.dst.lowSnapWarn
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the remaining number of Snapshot(tm) copies allocated for a given SnapVault(R) backup schedule on the given volume reaches or falls below the preset warning level. This event occurs on every failed attempt by SnapVault to create a backup Snapshot copy on the given backup schedule, until you resolve the condition.
*Corrective Action*::
Consider deleting some backup Snapshot copies from the given backup target to create some free slots. For more information and other solutions, see the Online Backup Recovery Guide.
*Syslog Message*::
Remaining number of Snapshot copies on the volume %s for the backup schedule %s is below the set warning level (%d of allocated %d).
*Parameters*::
*vol_name* (STRING): Name of the SnapVault secondary volume on which the backup Snapshot copy is created.
*target_name* (STRING): Base name of the backup schedule for which the given backup Snapshot copy is created.
*snap_cnt* (INT): Total number of backup Snapshot copies created for the given backup schedule.
*alloc_cnt* (INT): Total number of backup Snapshot copies allocated to the given backup schedule.

== snapvault.dst.opNotComplete
*Severity*::

*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): SnapVault(R) transfer type.
*srcfiler1* (STRING): SnapVault source system.
*srcpath1* (STRING): SnapVault source qtree.
*dstfiler1* (STRING): SnapVault destination system for first transfer (in progress). Source for second transfer (delayed).
*dstpath1* (STRING): SnapVault destination qtree for first transfer. Source for second transfer.
