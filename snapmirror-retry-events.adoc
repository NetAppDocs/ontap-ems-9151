== snapmirror.retry.replay
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when metadata replay fails in the process of making a Synchronous SnapMirror(R) destination flexible volume writable. This failure occurs because sufficient space was not available in the containing aggregate.
*Corrective Action*::
This error will not allow the destination volume to be made writable until additional space is made available in the containing aggregate. The snapmirror break command should be issued again after additional disks have been added to the aggregate.
*Syslog Message*::
Synchronous SnapMirror cannot proceed with snapmirror break for volume '%s' in containing aggregate '%s' because sufficient space was not available.
*Parameters*::
*dst_volume* (STRING): The name of the Synchronous SnapMirror(R) destination volume
*dst_aggr* (STRING): The name of the aggregate containing the destination volume
