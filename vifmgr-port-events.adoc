*Corrective Action*::
Change the port's MTU by using the "network port modify" command, or change the broadcast domain's MTU by using the "network port broadcast-domain modify" command.
*Syslog Message*::
The MTU of port %s (%d) does not match the MTU of broadcast domain %s (%d).
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the port.
*portmtu* (INT): MTU of the port.
*broadcast_domain* (STRING): Name of the broadcast domain.
*bdmtu* (INT): MTU of the broadcast domain.

== vifmgr.port.restored
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when configuration data for a network port is restored, typically for a network port that no longer exists or was partially removed previously. No action is required unless you were intentionally intending to remove the network port.
*Corrective Action*::
If you intentionally intended to remove the port, use the (privilege: advanced) "cluster ring show -unitname vifmgr" command to confirm that the network management component is online. If the component is online, use either the "network port ifgrp delete" or "network port vlan delete" command to remove the port again.
*Syslog Message*::
Configuration data for port %s in IPspace "%s" has been restored.
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.
*ipspace* (STRING): Name of the IPspace to which the port is assigned.

== vifmgr.port.shareBd
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when an administrator attempts to move a network port out of IPspace "Cluster", and that port is being used by the back-end HA or DR interconnect. Ports used for either the HA or DR interconnect must remain in IPspace "Cluster" and must be wired to either the cluster switch or directly to the associated HA partner, for two-node switchless clusters.
*Corrective Action*::
If the port has been added to a new broadcast domain, use the "network port broadcast-domain remove-ports" command to remove the port's broadcast domain association. When the port is no longer assigned to a broadcast domain, use the "network port broadcast-domain add-ports" command to add it to broadcast domain "Cluster" in IPspace "Cluster".
*Syslog Message*::
Port %s is shared with the HA or DR interconnect but has been moved from broadcast domain "Cluster" to broadcast domain "%s" of IPspace "%s".
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.
*broadcast_domain* (STRING): Name of the broadcast domain to which the port is assigned.
*ipspace* (STRING): Name of the IPspace to which the port is assigned.

== vifmgr.port.shareIpspace
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a cluster port that is shared with either the back-end HA or DR interconnect is assigned to an IPspace other than "Cluster", which is required for all shared ports. This condition can be encountered when a hardware refresh introduces a new platform that includes ports shared with either the HA or DR interconnect.
*Corrective Action*::
If necessary, use the "network port broadcast-domain remove-ports" command to remove the broadcast domain association from the port. After the port is no longer assigned to a broadcast domain, use the "network port broadcast-domain add-ports" command to add the port to broadcast domain "Cluster" in IPspace "Cluster".
*Syslog Message*::
Port %s in broadcast domain "%s" of IPspace "%s" is shared with the HA or DR interconnect, but is not assigned to IPspace "Cluster".
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.
*broadcast_domain* (STRING): Name of the broadcast domain to which the port is assigned.
*ipspace* (STRING): Name of the IPspace to which the port is assigned.

== vifmgr.port.shareMtu
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a cluster port shared with either the back-end HA or DR interconnect is found to be using an MTU other than 9000 bytes. For optimal performance, ports shared with the back-end interconnect should use an MTU of 9000 bytes. This condition can occur when a platform using network ports shared with either the back-end HA or DR interconnect is used in a mixed-version cluster, where one or more nodes still allows changes to the MTU setting for broadcast domain "Cluster".
*Corrective Action*::
If the port is currently assigned to broadcast domain "Cluster", use the "network port broadcast-domain modify" command to update broadcast domain "Cluster" to use an MTU of 9000 bytes.
*Syslog Message*::
Port %s in broadcast domain "%s" of IPspace "%s" is shared with the HA or DR interconnect, but has an MTU of %d bytes instead of 9000 bytes.
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.
*broadcast_domain* (STRING): Name of the broadcast domain to which the port is assigned.
*ipspace* (STRING): Name of the IPspace to which the port is assigned.
*mtu* (INT): MTU setting of the port.

== vifmgr.port.sharingDisabled
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when port sharing is disabled for a network port. This transition occurs when a network port is no longer available to be shared with the back-end HA or DR interconnect.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Sharing is disabled for port %s.
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.

== vifmgr.port.sharingEnabled
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when port sharing is enabled for a network port. Enabling port sharing facilitates bandwidth sharing with the back-end (high availability) HA and DR interconnect, which use the same physical port.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Sharing is enabled for port %s.
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.

== vifmgr.port.sharingError
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when an error is encountered while attempting to enable or disable sharing of a network port. If the port is being shared with the back-end HA or DR interconnect on this platform, those components might not be safely isolated from LIFs configured on the port. High utilization by either HA or DR traffic might negatively impact latency and bandwidth available to the cluster network.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "network port show" command to display the current link status of the affected network port. If the port is down, check any associated cabling and the status of the network switch it is connected to. If the problem persists, contact NetApp technical support for assistance.
*Syslog Message*::
Port "%s" could not be updated to the requested sharing state. Error: %s.
*Parameters*::
*port* (STRING): Name of the affected port.
*error* (STRING): Description of the error.

== vifmgr.port.vipCreated
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when an administrative action causes a VIP port to be created.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).

*Parameters*::
*vipPortName* (STRING): Name of the VIP port that was created.
*nodeName* (STRING): Name of the node on which the VIP port resides.

== vifmgr.port.vipDeleted
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when an administrative action causes a VIP port to be deleted.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
VIP port %s on node %s in IPspace %s has been deleted.
*Parameters*::

*Parameters*::
*vlanName* (STRING): Name of the VLAN created on the port.
*portName* (STRING): Name of the port on which the VLAN was created.
