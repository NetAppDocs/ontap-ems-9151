== mgmt.snapmir.dst.invalidType
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the destination volume of a SnapMirror(R) relationship is not of -type Data Protection (DP) or Load Sharing (LS), and a 'snapmirror initialize' operation is attempted. A volume must be of -type DP or LS to accept a 'snapmirror initialize' operation.
*Corrective Action*::
Use a different volume of -type DP or LS, or use the 'volume create' command to create a new volume of -type DP or LS to use as a destination of the SnapMirror relationship. You cannot modify the type of a volume using the 'volume modify' command.
*Syslog Message*::
Destination volume '%s' of a SnapMirror relationship is not of -type DP or LS. Job ID %llu.
*Parameters*::
*dstpath* (STRING): Path name of the destination volume of the SnapMirror relationship.
*jobID* (LONGINT): Job ID.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.bkt.del.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a bucket could not be deleted during a cleanup of a SnapMirror restore or create operation. Because the operation did not complete successfully, the bucket might be left in an inconsistent state.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "object-store-server bucket delete" command to delete the bucket.
*Syslog Message*::
Bucket "%s" could not be deleted as part of the clean up of a SnapMirror create or restore operation.
*Parameters*::
*bucket* (STRING): Name of the bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.crt.cleanup
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the cleanup of a link failed when it encountered an error during a SnapMirror create operation. Because the link could not be cleaned up properly, the bucket could be in an inconsistent state and might not be able to accept any traffic. Also, if the links are not cleaned up, a new SnapMirror relationship cannot be established with these two buckets.
*Corrective Action*::
1. Run the "snapmirror delete" command to delete the link.
*Syslog Message*::
Cleanup of the link between buckets "%s" and "%s" failed with error "%s".
*Parameters*::
*sourceBucket* (STRING): Name of the source bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.
*destBucket* (STRING): Name of the destination bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.
*error* (STRING): Error that was encountered.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.failover.rmt
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the remote bucket was not demoted during a failover operation. This could allow the remote bucket to still accept the traffic even though it is no longer permitted to so. Use the "demote bucket" command to avoid this situation.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "fabriclink demote-bucket" command in the cluster where remote bucket "%s" is located.
*Syslog Message*::
Failover failed for remote bucket "%s".
*Parameters*::
*remoteBucket* (STRING): Name of the remote bucket for which the failover operation failed.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.mod.rmt.fail
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the links on a remote cluster could not be modified during the execution of the "snapmirror modify" command. Even though the SnapMirror policy was modified, some of the links on the remote cluster could not be updated with new rpo/ throttle values. There is no detectable impact until a failover is performed. Only when a failover is performed would the reverse link be used, and it would still be functional even if the links on the remote cluster were not updated previously. They would just be using old rpo/throttle values.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Links on remote cluster "%s" were not modified.
*Parameters*::
*clusterUuid* (STRING): Cluster UUID of the cluster where the links were not updated.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.rstr.bkt.cln
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when objects in a restore bucket were not deleted during the cleanup of a SnapMirror restore operation. The restore bucket has objects in it even though the restore relationship no longer exists.
*Corrective Action*::
Delete the objects in bucket "%s".
*Syslog Message*::
Objects in bucket "%s" were not deleted during a restore failure cleanup.
*Parameters*::
*restoreBucket* (STRING): Name of the restore bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.rstr.cln.all
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the deletion of objects and the cleanup of link failed when the operations encountered an error during a SnapMirror restore operation. Because the link could not be cleaned up properly, the bucket could be in an inconsistent state and might not be able to accept any traffic. Also, if the links are not cleaned up, a new SnapMirror relationship cannot be established with these two buckets.
*Corrective Action*::
1. Run the "snapmirror delete" command to delete the link. 2. Delete the objects in the restore bucket.
*Syslog Message*::
Cleanup of the link between buckets "%s" and "%s" failed with error "%s" and the objects in the restore bucket could not be deleted.
*Parameters*::
*sourceBucket* (STRING): Name of the source bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.
*destBucket* (STRING): Name of the destination bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.
*error* (STRING): Error that was encountered.

== mgmt.snapmir.fl.rstr.lnk.cln
*Severity*::

*Corrective Action*::
Run the "snapmirror delete" command to delete the link.
*Syslog Message*::
Cleanup of the link between buckets "%s" and "%s" failed with error "%s".
*Parameters*::
*sourceBucket* (STRING): Name of the source bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.
*destBucket* (STRING): Name of the destination bucket in the SnapMirror relationship.
*error* (STRING): Error that was encountered.
