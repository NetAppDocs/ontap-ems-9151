*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the mutual exclusion has failed between the SnapMirror Synchronous and NFS v4.2 Security Labels features. This happens when an existing volume participating in a SnapMirror relationship receives an NFS "open", "create", or "setattr" operation carrying a security label. The system will not let a security label operation continue on a volume that participates in a SnapMirror Synchronous relationship, so the system administrator must either stop mirroring the volume or drop the security label operation completely.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
An incompatible NFS v4.2 security label operation was received on a file in volume "%s" having a SnapMirror Synchronous relationship. To allow NFS operations carrying security label on the volume, the mirroring must be stopped first: FSID "%d" SNAPID "%d" FILEID "%llu": "%s"
*Parameters*::
*volname* (STRING): Volume name.
*fsid* (INT): File System ID (FSID) of the volume.
*snapid* (INT): Snapshot copy ID.
*fileid* (LONGINT): File ID.
*error_msg* (STRING): Detailed error message to provide context while debugging the issue. The relevant input/output parameters of the message are also included to aid in debugging.
