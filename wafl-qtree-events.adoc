== wafl.qtree.id.mismatch
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a qtree ID derived from a WAFL(R) buffer does not match the given tree ID in a Snapshot(tm) copy.
*Corrective Action*::
Delete the Snapshot copy containing the qtree for non SnapMirror(R) DP volumes. For SnapMirror DP volumes, run wafliron with the "-include-mirrors" option set to true to fix the entry. For example, run the "wafliron start -aggr aggr_name -include-mirrors true" command, where aggr_name is the aggregate for the given volume.
*Syslog Message*::
Qtree ID %d is recorded as ID %d in %s %s%s%s%s in Snapshot copy %d.
*Parameters*::
*tid* (INT): Source tree identifier.
*id* (INT): Qtree root identifier.
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.
*snapId* (INT): Snapshot copy identifier.

== wafl.qtree.invalid.state
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the qtree file in a Snapshot(tm) copy is in an invalid state.
*Corrective Action*::
Delete the Snapshot copy containing the qtree for non SnapMirror(R) DP volumes. For SnapMirror DP volumes, run wafliron with the "-include-mirrors" option set to true to fix the entry.For example, run the "wafliron start -aggr aggr_name -include-mirrors true" command, where aggr_name is the aggregate for the given volume.
*Syslog Message*::
Qtree file in %s %s%s%s%s is in an invalid state %d in Snapshot copy %d.
*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Unique identifier for the volume in cases in which the volume name alone is insufficient.
*reason* (INT): State of the qtree file.
*snapId* (INT): Snapshot copy identifier.

== wafl.qtree.metafile.corrupt
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the qtree metafile in a Snapshot(tm) copy is inconsistent.
*Corrective Action*::
Run wafliron to fix the inconsistent volume. Use the "-include-mirrors" option if the volume is a SnapMirror(R) DP volume. For example, run the "wafliron start -aggr aggr_name -include-mirrors true" command, where aggr_name is the aggregate for the given volume.
*Syslog Message*::
Qtree metafile inconsistent in volume %s%s%s, Snapshot copy %d.
*Parameters*::
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Unique identifier for the volume in cases in which the volume name alone is insufficient.
*snapId* (INT): Snapshot copy identifier.

== wafl.qtree.qsmBreak.base
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the SnapMirror(R) information of the qtree is being removed as result of WAFL_check operation.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "snapmirror resync" or "snapmirror initialize" to reestablish the SnapMirror relationship.
*Syslog Message*::
Breaking SnapMirror qtree %d in %s %s%s%s%s: base Snapshot(tm) copy no longer exists. Use the "snapmirror resync" or "snapmirror initialize" to reestablish the SnapMirror relationship.
*Parameters*::
*qtree* (INT): Qtree identifier.
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.

== wafl.qtree.qsmBreak.iron
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the SnapMirror(R) information of the qtree is being removed as result of a wafliron operation.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "snapmirror resync" or "snapmirror initialize" command to reestablish the SnapMirror relationship.
*Syslog Message*::
Breaking SnapMirror qtree %d in %s %s%s%s%s: wafliron broke all SnapMirror relationships in %s %s%s%s%s. Use the "snapmirror resync" or "snapmirror initialize" command to reestablish the SnapMirror relationship.
*Parameters*::
*qtree* (INT): Qtree identifier.
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident1* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.
*type2* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner2* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol2* (STRING): Volume name.
*app2* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident2* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.
