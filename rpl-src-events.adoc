== rpl.src.lun.old_clone
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the replication source finds a LUN clone in a Snapshot(tm) copy that was created on a Data ONTAP(R) version earlier than 7.3 and was attempting to transfer as a LUN clone instead of a LUN. Transferring a LUN clone in a Snapshot(tm) copy that was created on Data ONTAP version earlier than 7.3 as a LUN clone might lead to divergence on the replication destination.
*Corrective Action*::
Only SnapVault(R) transfers that are managed using Ontapi can get into this situation. If SnapVault(R) restore is using a named Snapshot copy transfer, then choose a different named Snapshot copy. If SnapVault(R) is not using named Snapshot copy transfer, then delete the Snapshot copy and try again.
*Syslog Message*::
%s transfer from %s:%s to %s:%s is attempting to transfer a LUN clone from a pre Data ONTAP 7.3 Snapshot copy %s to the destination as a LUN clone.
*Parameters*::
*transfer_type* (STRING): Type of the transfer.
*source_filer* (STRING): System name of the replication source.
*source_path* (STRING): Path of the qtree where the clones reside.
*dest_filer* (STRING): System name of the replication destination.
*dest_path* (STRING): Replication destination path.
*snapname* (STRING): Name of the backup Snapshot copy of the LUN clone.
