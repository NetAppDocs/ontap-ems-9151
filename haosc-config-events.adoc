== haosc.config.unknown.cf
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the chassis and controller field-replaceable unit programmable read-only memories (FRU PROMs) have inconsistent data.
*Corrective Action*::
Boot into Maintenance mode and run the 'ha-config modify' command to set the controller and chassis configuration to stand-alone or HA, as appropriate. Exercise extreme caution. Setting the wrong configuration might lead to data loss.
*Syslog Message*::
Cannot determine whether configuration should be stand-alone or HA. Chassis is in %s configuration, and controller is in %s configuration.
*Parameters*::
*cha_config* (STRING): Chassis FRU PROM HA configuration string.
*cont_config* (STRING): Controller FRU PROM HA configuration string.

== haosc.config.unknown.ls
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the chassis and controller field-replaceable unit programmable read-only memory (FRU PROM) configurations conflict with the HA mode.
*Corrective Action*::
Boot into Maintenance mode and run the 'ha-config modify' command to set the controller and chassis configuration to stand-alone or HA, as appropriate. Setting the wrong configuration might lead to data loss. If you need assistance, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Cannot determine whether the configuration should be stand-alone or HA. Chassis is in %s configuration, controller is in %s configuration, and the HA mode is %s.
*Parameters*::
*cha_config* (STRING): Chassis FRU PROM HA configuration string.
*cont_config* (STRING): Controller FRU PROM HA configuration string.
*mode* (STRING): HA mode string.

== haosc.config.unknown.nv
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the chassis and controller field-replaceable unit programmable read-only memories (FRU PROMs) have factory default configurations and the nonvolatile memory is dirty.
*Corrective Action*::
Boot into Maintenance mode and run the 'ha-config modify' command to set the controller and chassis configuration to stand-alone or HA, as appropriate. Setting the wrong configuration might lead to data loss. If you need assistance, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Cannot determine whether configuration should be stand-alone or HA. Chassis is in %s configuration, controller is in %s configuration, and the nonvolatile memory is dirty.
*Parameters*::
*cha_config* (STRING): Chassis FRU PROM HA configuration string.
*cont_config* (STRING): Controller FRU PROM HA configuration string.
