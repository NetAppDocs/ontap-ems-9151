== scsi.cmd.aborted
*Deprecated*::
This event has been removed as it does not provide any useful information for a customer.
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
The aborted event is issued if an I/O request is aborted by a class driver.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
%s device %s: Command aborted: cdb %s (%d).
*Parameters*::
*deviceType* (STRING): The device type.
*deviceName* (STRING): The electrical path name of the device on which the command was aborted.
*cdb* (STRING): A string containing the opcode byte of the CDB which was sent to the device. If the opcode was for a READ(10) or a WRITE(10), the logical block address and the transfer length are included as well.
*dTime* (INT): The delta time from when the command was first issued.

== scsi.cmd.abortedByHost
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the host adapter aborts an I/O request, either because it was a victim or because of an HA timeout.
*Corrective Action*::
This condition does not necessarily mean that the target device is problematic. High workloads can cause loop saturation, leading to device contention for the bus. Transport issues can also cause loop throughput to decrease, thereby causing I/Os to take longer than normal. Seen occasionally, no action is required; the system handles the condition automatically by retrying the I/O that was aborted. Seen in association with a persistent error condition, such as device resets or transport errors, it is likely the symptom of a loop stability problem.

*disk_information* (STRING): Formatted information about the disk, including the disk's vendor, model, firmware revision, and serial number.

== scsi.cmd.adapterFatal
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
The adapter fatal event is issued when the host adapter has detected a problem with either the buffer list or has exceeded the DMA size.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
%s device %s: Adapter fatal error: HA status 0x%x: cdb %s.
*Parameters*::

== scsi.cmd.adapterHardwareError
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
The adapter hardware error is issued when the host adapter has detected a loop is down, the scsi bus transport had an error or a problem with the adapter hardware itself.
*Corrective Action*::
Evaluate for partial component failure the following loop hardware involved in the Fibre Channel transport: cables, transceivers, and I/O modules (LRC, ESH/ESH2, AT-FC, AT-FC2, and AT-FCX). If this error occurs in conjunction with transport errors on the same loop, ensure that all drive carriers are seated firmly in their enclosure bays, and verify that all cables are properly connected and undamaged. Also check the backplane connectors--if they are bent or broken, you must replace them. If the error persists for a specific device or I/O module from multiple adapters, you should replace that hardware module.

== scsi.cmd.checkCondition
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a check condition is recieved from a device. A check condition is the mechanism whereby a target device reports an informational condition or error status to the requesting host. Either the condition that generated this event is an error that occurred during execution of the command and was not cleared by retrying the request or an informational condition reporting status of the present operation or media state.
*Corrective Action*::
A target status of check condition normally indicates an error at the device during execution of the requested command. Such cases are often the result of an intermittent device hardware or firmware problem that is automatically handled by the Data ONTAP drivers through command retries. In cases of repeated events, the specified device should be evaluated for proper operation and possible repair or replacement. A check condition with a SenseKey of "no sense" indicates an informational condition that is automatically handled by the Data ONTAP driver associated with the target device. These are normally not reported as error events. However, on occasion an unexpected informational condition may be reported by a target device. These cases should not be interpreted as a failure of the target device.
*Syslog Message*::
%s device %s: Check Condition: CDB %s: Sense Data %s - %s (0x%x - 0x%x 0x%x 0x%x)(%d). %s
*Parameters*::
*deviceType* (STRING): The device type.
*deviceName* (STRING): The electrical path name of the device on which the command failed.
*cdb* (STRING): A string containing the opcode byte of the Command block which encountered the error. For opcodes of READ (0x28) or WRITE (0x2a), the logical block address and the transfer length are also included.
*sSenseKey* (STRING): A string containing a description of the sense key for the failed command.
*sSenseCode* (STRING): A string containing a description of the sense code for the failed command. If no description is available, this is a null string.

*iASCQ* (INTHEX): The integer value of the sense code qualifier for the failed command.
*iFRU* (INTHEX): The integer value of the fru for the failed command.
*DTime* (INT): Delta time from first issued to sense logged.
*disk_information* (STRING): Formatted information about the disk, including the disk's vendor, model, firmware revision, and serial number.

== scsi.cmd.checkCondition.ATATimeout
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
An ATATimeout error typically indicates a problem in communicating with a disk in an ATFCX-bridged shelf.
*Corrective Action*::
An initial ATA I/O Timeout will result in a SOFT RESET being issued to the disk in question. Subsequent ATA I/O Timeouts will result in a HARD RESET being performed to the disk followed by a POWER CYCLE of the disk. When any of these errors are encountered, ATFCX shelflog information is also updated. Check shelflog dynamic and persistent log information for controller details on the event. Check environment shelf_stats output for additional error statistics from the disk in question. Check disk shm_stats and disk shm_stats ha.disk_id for SMART log information from the disk in question. Collating this information will help determine if this is an isolated disk problem or a controller related problem. If the environment shelf_stats are clean along with the shelflog entries, then the error is probably a misbehaving disk. If the problem continues, RMA of the disk is recommended. However, if shelf_stats are not clean and/or shelflog errors are present, RMA of the ATFCX module is recommended.

== scsi.cmd.pastTimeToLive
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when an I/O request is not completed in the maximum time allowed. It is possible that the target device is attempting an error recovery operation that is impeding the progress of other I/O requests. Often these conditions are not permanent and can be cleared by retrying the request. However, the system must limit the maximum time it waits for a device to successfully complete a request. Similarly, the number of retries is also limited. If the number of retries is not exhausted before the maximum time allowed is exceeded, this event is generated.
*Corrective Action*::
If there are command timeouts associated with the device specified in this event and there are no other devices on the same bus/loop experiencing similar problems, the device should be evaluated for proper operation and possible repair/replacement.

== scsi.cmd.selectionTimeout
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the host adapter returns either a selection time out error (SCSI) or an invalid target error (FC). In effect, the specified device failed to acknowledge a request.
*Corrective Action*::
Either the targeted device failed to respond or the address of the targeted device is no longer valid. If an alternate path to the device exists, the I/O will be automatically retried on the alternate path. If seen in conjunction with other timeouts on the same bus/loop, there may be a problem with the bus/loop, not the specific device. If this event is not seen in conjunction with any other error recovery activity on the same bus/loop, the specified device should be evaluated for proper operation and possible replacement.

== scsi.cmd.transportError
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when an I/O request encounters a transport error during command execution. Transport errors are typically the result of an incomplete data transfer (e.g., device expected more data than was received from the host adapter, or the adapter expected more data than was received from the device), a data overrun meaning that more data was transferred than was expected, a physical link transmission (parity or CRC) error, or a bus protocol error (phase error or an unexpected bus state transition.)
*Corrective Action*::
Transport errors are typically unexpected events. The exception is when drives are physically added or removed from the bus or drive enclosure. However, transport protocols do account for detection and recovery of transmission errors through CRC or Parity mechanisms. When such an error is reported to the adapter driver, the associated request is retried. For example, on a Fibre Channel link, an occasional transmission error is consistent with the expected Bit Error Rate specifications of the link. Output from the fcadmin link_stats command can be used to obtain error counts for CRC and transport errors. If they exceed observed values from normally operating loops, loop hardware should be evaluated for partial failure of a component involved in the Fibre Channel transport. Common things to check include complete seating of drive carriers in enclosure bays, properly secured cable connections, LRC/ESH seating, and crimped or otherwise damaged cables.
*Syslog Message*::
%s device %s: Transport error during execution of command: HA status 0x%x: cdb %s.
*Parameters*::
*deviceType* (STRING): The device type.
*deviceName* (STRING): The electrical path name of the device on which the command failed.
*ha_status* (INTHEX): Value returned by the host adapter driver describing completion status of I/O request execution at the transport or physical link layer.
*cdb* (STRING): A string containing the opcode byte of the CDB which was sent to the device. If the opcode was for a READ (0x28) or a WRITE (x02a) command, the logical block address and the transfer length are included as well.
*disk_information* (STRING): Formatted information about the disk, including the disk's vendor, model, firmware revision, and serial number.

== scsi.cmd.transportErrorEMSOnly
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when an I/O request encounters a transport error during command execution. Transport errors are typically unexpected events, unless you added or removed disk drives from the bus or drive enclosure. Unexpected transport errors are typically the result of the following conditions: An incomplete data transfer where the device expected more data from the host adapter than it received (or the adapter expected more data from the device than it received); A data overrun where more data than expected was transferred; A physical link transmission (parity or CRC [cyclic redundancy check]) error; Or a bus protocol error (phase error or unexpected bus state transition).
*Corrective Action*::
Transport protocols do account for detection and recovery of transmission errors through CRC or parity mechanisms. When this error is reported to the adapter driver, the associated request is retried. For example, on a Fibre Channel link, an occasional transmission error is consistent with the expected Bit Error Rate specifications of the link. Therefore, use output from the "fcadmin link_stats" command to obtain error counts for CRC and transport errors. If the error counts exceed observed values from normally operating loops, evaluate for partial component failure the loop hardware involved in the Fibre Channel transport. Common things to check include complete seating of drive carriers in enclosure bays, properly secured cable connections, complete LRC/ESH module seating, and crimped or otherwise damaged cables.
