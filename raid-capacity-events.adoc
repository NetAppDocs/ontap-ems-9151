== raid.capacity.license.alloc
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system creates a new aggregate, or registers a new capacity for an existing aggregate.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Registered licensed capacity (%llu%s) for %s aggregate %s UUID %s - operation: %s, simulated: %d.
*Parameters*::
*capacity* (LONGINT): Capacity registered for the aggregate against the license manager.
*capacity_unit* (STRING): Capacity unit (MB, GB, TB) for registered capacity.
*mirrored* (STRING): "mirrored" if the aggregate is mirrored; "unmirrored" otherwise.
*aggregate_name* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.
*aggregate_uuid* (STRING): Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) of the aggregate.
*operation* (STRING): Aggregate operation triggering the license capacity update.
*simulated* (INT): 1 if the operation is simulated; 0 if the operation is not simulated.
*root* (INT): 1 if the aggregate is a root aggregate; 0 if it is a data aggregate.
*status* (INT): Synchronous status returned by the license capacity alloc call.
*callback* (INT): Indicates whether callback requested
*sequence* (INT): Sequence number to prevent suppression of duplicate messages.

== raid.capacity.license.free
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system destroys an aggregate, and thus frees its registered license capacity.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Freed licensed capacity of aggregate %s UUID %s operation: %s.
*Parameters*::
*aggregate_name* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.
*aggregate_uuid* (STRING): Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) of the aggregate.
*operation* (STRING): Aggregate operation triggering the license capacity free.
*status* (INT): Synchronous status returned by the license capacity free call.
*sequence* (INT): Sequence number to prevent suppression of duplicate messages.

== raid.capacity.license.status
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system attempts to update the licensed capacity of the system due to an aggregate operation.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Status of licensing request %s, aggregate %s, licensed capacity %llu%s, capacity remaining %llu%s, additional capacity required %llu%s.
*Parameters*::
*status_string* (STRING): Status of the licensing request.
*aggregate_name* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.
*licensed_size* (LONGINT): Licensed capacity of the aggregate.
*licensed_size_unit* (STRING): Capacity unit (MB, GB, TB) for licensed capacity.
*capacity_left* (LONGINT): Capacity remaining in the license.
*capacity_left_unit* (STRING): Capacity unit (MB, GB, TB) for capacity remaining.
*capacity_required* (LONGINT): Additional licensed capacity required for this operation.
*capacity_required_unit* (STRING): Capacity unit (MB, GB, TB) for additional capacity required.
*status_code* (INT): Specific status code returned by the licensing request.
*sequence* (INT): Sequence number to prevent suppression of duplicate messages.
