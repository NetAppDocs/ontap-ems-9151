*Description*::
This message occurs when a RAID label read I/O failure is detected. Data ONTAP(R) takes appropriate recovery actions, as described in additional logged events.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Label read on %s failed with storage error %s. The system will stop using the disk for I/O operations.
*Parameters*::
*disk_info* (STRING): Formatted information about the disk.
*error_str* (STRING): Error string.
*instanceFile* (STRING): Internal file code.
*instanceId* (INT): Internal instance identifier.
*shelf* (STRING): Identifier of the shelf where the disk is located.
*bay* (STRING): Disk bay within the shelf where the disk is located.
*vendor* (STRING): Name of the vendor of the disk.

*firmware_revision* (STRING): Firmware revision number of the disk.
*serialno* (STRING): Serial number of the disk.
*disk_type* (INT): Type of disk drive.
*disk_rpm* (STRING): Rotational speed of the disk, in RPM.
*carrier* (STRING): Unique ID of the carrier in which the disk is installed.
*site* (STRING): For a MetroCluster(tm) configuration, indicates the site {Local|Remote} where the disk is located. For non-MetroCluster configurations, site is 'Local'.
