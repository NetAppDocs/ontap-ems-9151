== cf.badShelfCountVersion
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event occurs if we are sent a negotiated failover shelf count message with a version which we don't support. As a result, disk shelf count negotiated failover will not work. This is likely due to a kernel version mismatch.
*Corrective Action*::
Upgrade the down-rev node so both nodes are on the same version.
*Syslog Message*::
Disk shelf count message with unsupported version received from partner.
*Parameters*::
(None).
