== dfu.noMemory
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the disk firmware update routine cannot allocate memory to update the disk firmware.
*Corrective Action*::
Memory allocation relies on the availability of memory resources in the system. If possible, reduce the workload so that fewer resources are needed. Rebooting the system can recover memory resources that might have been lost. If the failure persists after reducing the workload and rebooting, contact NetApp technical support for assistance in determining whether additional system memory is indicated.
*Syslog Message*::

*vendorName* (STRING): Name of the vendor of the disk.
*productId* (STRING): Product ID of the disk.
*fwVersion* (STRING): Firmware version of the disk.
