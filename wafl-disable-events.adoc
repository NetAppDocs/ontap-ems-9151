== wafl.disable.vol.guarantee
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the volume guarantee of a flexible volume is disabled due to aggregate space being physically overallocated.
*Corrective Action*::
Remount the aggregate after creating space by increasing the aggregate size or by deleting/moving some volumes to the other aggregates. Use the "storage aggregate show-space" command to view the current space usage of the aggregate. To increase an aggregate's size, add disks by using the "storage aggregate add-disks" command. Aggregate Snapshot copies are deleted automatically to make some space when the aggregate is full.
*Syslog Message*::
Volume guarantee on volume "%s" is disabled after the aggregate "%s" becomes physically overallocated.
*Parameters*::
*vol* (STRING): Volume name whose guarantee is getting disabled.
*aggr* (STRING): The aggregate name on which the volume whose guarantee is getting disabled resides.
