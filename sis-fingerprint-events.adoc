NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a bad block is encountered while reading SIS metafiles. As a result, some of the fingerprint records used to identify blocks for use in deduplication might have been lost. The only impact from this is lower efficiency in deduplication.

(None).
*Syslog Message*::
