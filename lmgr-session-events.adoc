== lmgr.session.failed
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event occurs when a SpinNP session has failed, which causes session-scoped (e.g. CIFS) locks on the D-blade to be dropped. Only affects locks acquired using the failed session. This will cause clients to see a service disruption until they re-connect to the server.
*Corrective Action*::
None -- clients will automatically try to reconnect to the server, re-locking files as necessary.
*Syslog Message*::
Dropped session-scoped locks from session %s:%s:%s due to failed session.
*Parameters*::
*initiator* (STRING): The blade ID of the initiator.
*uniquifier* (STRING): The session uniquifier.
*target* (STRING): The blade ID of the target.
