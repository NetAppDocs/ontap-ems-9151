== lmgr.recons.CA.lock.dropped
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when locks established through CIFS Continuously Available (CA) shares are dropped after a takeover, giveback, or aggregate relocation. This is because the multi-protocol lock manager finds bad mirrored lock state for CA locks and skips reconstructing them. This causes a client to see a service disruption on the file to which the CA locks belong.
*Corrective Action*::
Reopen the file to reestablish CA locks.
*Syslog Message*::
A Continuously Available (CA) lock for volume %s%s/%s (DSID %08x) file %d snapshot copy %d reconnect key %d is dropped because of %s.
*Parameters*::
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Volume identifier to uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name alone is insufficient.
*dsid* (LONGINT): Data set identifier.
*fileid* (INT): File identifier.
*snapid* (INT): Snapshot(tm) copy in which the file exists, 0 for the active file system.
*reconnect_key* (INT): Open identifier to uniquely identify a durable or persistent open on a volume
*reason* (STRING): Description of the reason for dropping a CA lock.
