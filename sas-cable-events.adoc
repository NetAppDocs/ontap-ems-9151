== sas.cable.degraded
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the cable attached to SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) adapter port is functioning in a degraded mode.
*Corrective Action*::
This condition implies one or more of the lanes in a 4-wide cable is fuctioning at a less-than-optimal speed, or is not functioning and has been disabled. The port will continue functioning but in a degraded, lower-performing mode. The cable should be replaced at some point in the future.
*Syslog Message*::
Cable attached to SAS port "%s" is functioning in a degraded mode.
*Parameters*::
*adapterName* (STRING): The name of the associated SAS host bus adapter.

== sas.cable.linkratelow
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the expander or cable attached to the SAS (serial-attached SCSI) host bus adapter port is functioning at a speed lower than its specification. This could happen because the HBA is connected to an IOM that supports a lower speed, or because of a speed degradation due to a faulty component, or because of a lower common shelf stack speed.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Expander or cable attached to SAS port %s is operating at %s, which is lower than expected.
*Parameters*::
*adapterName* (STRING): Name of the associated SAS host bus adapter.
*currentSpeed* (STRING): Current link rate for SAS host bus adapter, cable, and IOM expander.

== sas.cable.unqualified
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) cable attached to a controller port has not been qualified by NetApp. Unqualified cables might exhibit unpredictable behavior or experience higher error rates than qualified cables.
*Corrective Action*::
Replace the cable with one qualified by NetApp
*Syslog Message*::
Cable attached to SAS port %s has not been qualified by NetApp
*Parameters*::
*adapterName* (STRING): Name of the associated SAS host bus adapter port.
