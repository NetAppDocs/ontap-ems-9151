== raid.sp.add.aggr.grow.noDone
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when one or more aggregate's capacity is not increased as part of the storage pool add job.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the (privilege: diagnostic) "storage pool add -storage-pool <storage pool name> -auto-grow-aggregates" command to retry the operation. If the condition persists, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Could not grow one or more aggregates provisioned from storage pool %s.
*Parameters*::
*name* (STRING): Name of the storage pool.
*uuid* (STRING): UUID of the storage pool.
*jobid* (LONGINT): ID of the job.

== raid.sp.add.success
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when disks are added to the storage pool and all the aggregates provisioned from the storage pool have been grown to take capacity from new disks.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Disks %s added to storage pool %s.
*Parameters*::
*disks* (STRING): List of disks added to the storage pool.
*name* (STRING): Name of the storage pool.
*uuid* (STRING): UUID of the storage pool.
*jobid* (LONGINT): ID of the job.

== raid.sp.aggr.add.rollback
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when available capacity is reassigned to a storage pool because adding storage pool capacity to an aggregate failed. This can happen if the node owning the aggregate is rebooted while additional storage pool capacity is zeroing. Other events provide additional failure information.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Aggregate add job for aggregate %s successfully rolled back available capacity to storage pool %s.
*Parameters*::
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the aggregate to which capacity is being added.
*name* (STRING): Name of the storage pool.
*uuid* (STRING): UUID of the storage pool.
*aggrUuid* (STRING): UUID of the aggregate.
*owner* (STRING): Owning node of the aggregate.
*curUnit* (INT): Current available allocation unit.
*prevUnit* (INT): Allocation unit available before the job started.
*jobid* (LONGINT): ID of the job.

== raid.sp.aggr.add.success
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when capacity from a storage pool is added to an aggregate.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Added %d allocation units from storage pool %s to aggregate %s.
*Parameters*::
*allocationUnits* (INT): Number of allocation units added.
*name* (STRING): Name of the storage pool.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the aggregate to which capacity is added.
*uuid* (STRING): UUID of the storage pool.
*aggrUuid* (STRING): UUID of the aggregate.
*jobid* (LONGINT): ID of the job.

== raid.sp.aggr.grow.success
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when an aggregate capacity is successfully increased to span all disks belonging to a storage pool.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
%s added to aggregate %s from storage pool %s.
*Parameters*::
*capacity* (STRING): Amount of capacity added to the aggregate.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the aggregate whose capacity is increased.
*name* (STRING): Name of the storage pool.
*uuid* (STRING): UUID of the storage pool.
*aggrUuid* (STRING): UUID of the aggregate.
*jobid* (LONGINT): ID of the job.

== raid.sp.create.failure
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a storage pool creation operation fails.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "storage pool delete -storage-pool <storage pool name>" command to delete the partially created storage pool and then retry the create operation. If the condition persists, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Storage pool %s was not successfully created. Reason: %s
*Parameters*::
