== showmount.update.failed
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the showmount job fails to update the "exports.data" file. This file provides a list of exported volumes and qtrees on the NFS server to any clients running the "showmount -e" command.
*Corrective Action*::
Verify that the root volume of the Vserver is online and not full. After the Vserver is online and space is available, run the following command: "export-policy cache flush -vserver <vserver-name> -cache showmount".
*Syslog Message*::
Flushing to exports.data file failed on Vserver "%s".
*Parameters*::
*vserver* (STRING): Name of the Vserver where the problem is occurring.
