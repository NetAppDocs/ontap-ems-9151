*Description*::
This message occurs when the disks selected during aggregate creation and mirroring, disk addition, disk replacement, or reconstruction results in two disks from the same disk carrier being part of a single RAID group. The carrier should not be removed; otherwise the RAID group is doubly degraded, which significantly reduces performance. This situation also increases the chance of data loss. Data loss could occur because of either the user forcing the command to make such a disk selection, or Data ONTAP(R) could not find more suitable disks. This event is generated for every pair of disks residing in a disk carrier that would become part of a single RAID group. Data ONTAP makes appropriate recovery actions. One or more disk copies are performed to correct the problem.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
(None).
*Parameters*::
*disk1* (STRING): Name of the first disk in the disk carrier.
*disk2* (STRING): Name of the second disk in the disk carrier.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the RAID group.
*rg* (STRING): Name of the RAID group.
