*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the KMIP2 client cannot import an NSE key from a KMIP key server. A key was retrieved from a KMIP key server, but an error occurred when trying to add the key to an ONTAP(R) data structure.
*Corrective Action*::
Run the "security key-manager restore" command to restore keys from external key servers.
*Syslog Message*::
KMIP2 client failed to import NSE key from KMIP key server, error: %d
*Parameters*::
*err* (INT): Error code from system call to sysctlbyname().

== kmip2.cannot.import.NVE.key
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the KMIP2 client cannot import an NVE key from a KMIP key server. A key was retrieved from a KMIP key server, but an error occurred when trying to add the key to an ONTAP(R) data structure.
*Corrective Action*::

== kmip2.cannot.read.client.cert
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the client certificate cannot be read. On a Cloud ONTAP(R) system, this message indicates one of the following: 1) A request to create an encrypted aggregate will not succeed because the key cannot be sent to the external KMIP server, or 2) The request to retrieve a key from the external KMIP server will fail. In this case, the encrypted aggregate will not be able to be mounted. On a NSE system, this message indicates one of the following: 1) A request to re-key a NSE drive will not succeed because the key cannot be sent to the external KMIP server, or 2) The ability to read/write data to/from a NSE drive might be impacted if power to the drive or to the disk shelf is lost.
*Corrective Action*::
Examine the KMIP client certificate and ensure that the certificate has been created properly.
*Syslog Message*::
KMIP Failed to read client certificate with error: %s
*Parameters*::
*err* (STRING): KMIP error code.

== kmip2.cannot.read.private.key
*Severity*::

*Description*::
This message occurs when the client private key certificate can't be read. On a Cloud ONTAP(R) system, this message indicates one of the following: 1) A request to create an encrypted aggregate will not succeed because the key cannot be sent to the external KMIP server, or 2) The request to retrieve a key from the external KMIP server will fail. In this case, the encrypted aggregate will not be able to be mounted. On a NSE system, this message indicates one of the following: 1) A request to re-key a NSE drive will not succeed because the key cannot be sent to the external KMIP server, or 2) The ability to read/write data to/from a NSE drive might be impacted if power to the drive or to the disk shelf is lost.
*Corrective Action*::
Examine the KMIP client private certificate and ensure that the certificate has been created properly.
*Syslog Message*::
