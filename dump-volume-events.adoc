*Severity*::
NOTICE

This event is generated when we are trying to dump a volume which is full and we cannot write the offsetmap on to the disk and we are using memory instead of disk to do this.

Please free up some of the disk space for this volume in order to avoid this memory consumption.
*Syslog Message*::
DUMP using memory due to lack of disk space on /vol/%s.
