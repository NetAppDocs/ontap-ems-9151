*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when a node fails to retrieve a complete set of encryption keys from the configured key servers by the time the management process comes online.

Use the "security key-manager external restore -node <node> -vserver <vserver>" command to manually restore the keys.

Key auto-retrieve failed on node %s for Vserver %s (ID %u, UUID %s).
*Parameters*::
*node* (STRING): Name of the node whose management process goes online.
*vserver* (STRING): Name of the Vserver that could not retrieve all of the keys.
