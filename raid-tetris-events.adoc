== raid.tetris.cksum.bno
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system detects a block number mismatch during a write operation. The expected Virtual Block Number (VBN)/Disk Block Number (DBN) is not the same as the stored VBN/DBN from the checksum entry indicating that the block is read from the wrong location. Data ONTAP(R) makes appropriate recovery actions. Other events describe those actions.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Block number mismatch on %s%s: stored_dbn = %u, expected_dbn = %llu; stored_vbn = %llu, expected_vbn = %llu during write operation.
*Parameters*::
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the affected aggregate.
*disk_info* (STRING): Information about the disk object that contains the error, including disk name, path, shelf, bay, serial number, vendor, model, rpm, and carrier serial number.
