DBS has detected low filesystem free space on node %u/%s. Cluster fault type %s, fault ID %u, status %u. %s
*Parameters*::
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node. It is "0" if there is no associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Universal unique identifier (UUID) of the associated node. If there is no associated node, zeroes display.
*cfType* (STRING): DBS cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): DBS cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
