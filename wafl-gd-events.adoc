== wafl.gd.alloc.size.rsrv.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when reserving allocation size fails for a file using granular data because there is no space available in the volume.
*Corrective Action*::
Create space by increasing the volume or aggregate sizes, or by deleting data or deleting Snapshot copies. To increase a volume's size, use the "volume size" command. To delete a volume's Snapshot copies, use the "volume snapshot delete" command. To increase an aggregate's size, add disks by using the "storage aggregate add-disks" command. Aggregate Snapshot copies are deleted automatically when the aggregate is full.
*Syslog Message*::
Reserving allocation size for fileid "%d" on volume "%s%s%s%s" fails because there is no space available in the volume.
*Parameters*::
*fileid* (INT): File identifier.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the volume.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the volume.
*app* (STRING): Application universal unique identifier (UUID).
*volident* (STRING): Volume identifier that uniquely identifies the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.

== wafl.gd.convert.scan.running
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when converting a file to use granular data fails because a scanner is currently running on the volume. The conversion cannot be completed until the scan is complete or filesystem inconsistencies can occur. Granular data conversion is required for non-disruptive file moves that occur as part of volume rebalancing.
*Corrective Action*::
Retry the operation after some time to allow the scan to complete. If the problem persists, contact NetApp technical support for assistance.
*Syslog Message*::
Granular data conversion failed for fileid "%d" on volume "%s%s%s%s" because scan "%s" is currently running on the volume.
*Parameters*::
*fileid* (INT): File identifier.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the volume.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the volume.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Volume identifier that uniquely identifies the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.
*scantype* (STRING): Type of scan.

== wafl.gd.convert.unknown.pvbn
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when converting a file to use granular data fails because the file contains unresolved physical block numbers (PVBNs). Unresolved PVBNs occur when you move a volume to a different aggregate. PVBNs are resolved by a background process following the volume move.
*Corrective Action*::
Retry the operation after some time to allow the background process to complete.
*Syslog Message*::
Granular data conversion failed for fileid "%d" on volume "%s%s%s%s" because the inode contains unresolved PVBNs.
*Parameters*::
*fileid* (INT): File identifier.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the volume.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the volume.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Volume identifier that uniquely identifies the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.
