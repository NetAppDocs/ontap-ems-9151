ONTAP has increased the Snapshot(tm) copy reserve percentage on this AppDM volume from zero to five percent as part of the upgrade to ONTAP 9.5. To retain the same available free space on the volume, consider increasing the size of the volume by five percent by using the "vol modify -size" command. It might be necessary to increase the size of the aggregate first, using the "aggr add-disks" command.

This number of files puts a constraint on the minimum size of the volume when it is automatically shrunk. This message indicates that the automatic shrinking of a volume did not reach the configuration's minimum size because it is constrained by the number of files the volume is allowed to contain.

*Corrective Action*::
Either increase the size of the corresponding aggregate by adding disks, or decrease the total volume space requirements in the aggregate by shrinking or destroying one or more volumes.

== wafl.vol.guarantee.stayoff
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when WAFL(R) would otherwise have attempted to enable a volume's space guarantee, but the last time it tried, an error was encountered (most likely due to insufficient space). This error was recorded in the volume's on-disk RAID label so that the same error would not be repeated on future mounts. The volume will be mounted. However, because the volume is not guaranteed, it is possible that subsequent writes to the volume could fail if the volume's aggregate becomes full.
*Corrective Action*::
Determine the cause of the error the last time WAFL attempted to enable this guarantee, either through logs or by attempting to enable it again manually. Typically, the issue is a lack of space at mount time detected during boot, which can be resolved by increasing the size of the corresponding aggregate (by adding disks or by shrinking or destroying some of the aggregate's volumes). After the issue is resolved, manually attempt to re-enable the guarantee using the 'volume modify' command.
*Syslog Message*::
The space guarantee for volume %s%s was not enabled because an error occurred the last time a guarantee was enabled on this volume.
*Parameters*::
*vol* (STRING): Name of the volume.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Volume identifier.

View the current value of the file threshold by using the command "volume show <volume-name> -fields files". If volume modify fails, increase volume size and try again.
*Syslog Message*::
The file system on %s %s%s%s%s is currently using %d%% of the files that can be contained on the volume. The admin has configured the threshold for monitoring public inode usage as %d%%.
*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).

== wafl.vol.mirrorType.invalid
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::

*Corrective Action*::
This condition cannot be fixed by file system repair mechanisms such as wafliron. The data is not lost, but it is inaccessible to the administrator. To access the data, contact NetApp technical support. Alternatively, the administrator can destroy the mirror volume by using the 'volume delete -vserver vserver_name -volume vol_name' command.

*Severity*::
NOTICE

== wafl.Vol.QuiesceTO.RalDrain
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs during a volume move operation, when a volume quiesce attempt fails to drain all of the outstanding remote cached inodes within the allowable time frame. This can occur and might persist on a heavily loaded system, and it prevents the move from being completed. However, as soon as the load drops to a more reasonable level, ONTAP flushes the cached inodes and completes the move without customer intervention.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Quiescing of volume %s failed because it was unable to drain all outstanding remote inodes for the volume. Initially the volume reported %d cached inodes, but timed out with %d cached inodes remaining.
*Parameters*::
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*nStart* (INT): Number of cached inodes when drain starts.
*nEnd* (INT): Number of cached inodes when request times out.
