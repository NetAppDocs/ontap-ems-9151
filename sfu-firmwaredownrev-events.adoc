== sfu.firmwareDownrev.shelf
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the disk shelf is running downrev firmware, and a later version is available in the /etc/shelf_fw directory. The shelf cannot be updated automatically, possibly because automatic shelf firmware update is disabled.

*Syslog Message*::
