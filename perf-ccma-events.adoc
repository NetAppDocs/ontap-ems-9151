== perf.ccma.off
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the performance archiver is not enabled, which makes it difficult for technical support to troubleshoot performance issues on the system.
*Corrective Action*::
Enable the performance archiver to track system activity and allow technical support to troubleshoot performance problems by running the "statistics archive config modify -is-enabled true" command. Note that the performance archiver is disabled during takeover and giveback, and in a failure scenario when the archiver loses communication with the Counter Manager Quota Management system; these two scenarios do not resolve by administratively enabling the archiver.
*Syslog Message*::
Performance archiver is not enabled for datastore '%s'.
*Parameters*::
*datastore* (STRING): Datastore name.
