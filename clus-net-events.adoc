== clus.net.noNeighbors
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when the cluster network ports with "link" reported as "up" are neither receiving CDP nor LLDP neighbor announcements. This is not a supported configuration and can negatively impact the performance of the cluster.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "network port show -ipspace Cluster -link up" command to list the ports expected to receive CDP and/or LLDP announcements. Verify that CDP and/or LLDP is enabled on the switch the cluster ports are wired to. Use the "network device-discovery show" command to view the announcements for each of the cluster ports.
*Syslog Message*::
The cluster ports with "link" reported as "up" are neither receiving CDP nor LLDP neighbor announcements.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== clus.net.switchlessInv
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the "switchless-cluster" option is disabled, but one or more cluster ports are directly wired to a cluster port on another node. This could result in packet loss across the cluster network, causing file operations to fail as well as loss of quorum.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "network options switchless-cluster modify" command to enable support for switchless clusters.
*Syslog Message*::
One or more cluster ports are directly wired to a cluster port on another node, but the "switchless-cluster" option is not enabled.
*Parameters*::
(None).

== clus.net.switchlessMismatch
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the "switchless-cluster" option is enabled, but all of the cluster ports are wired to a switch. This configuration will negatively impact the performance of the cluster network.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "network options switchless-cluster modify" command to disable support for switchless clusters.
*Syslog Message*::
All of the cluster ports are wired to a switch, but the "switchless-cluster" option is enabled.
*Parameters*::
(None).
