*evtType* (STRING): Type of the original DBS event.
*serviceID* (INT): Service ID that identifies the associated DBS service. It is 0 if there is no associated service.
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node. It is 0 if there is no associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Generated Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) of the associated node. It displays zeroes if there is no associated node.
*driveID* (INT): Drive ID number of the associated drive. It is 0 if there is no associated drive.

This message occurs when the Distributed Block Store (DBS) detects the database connection to less than half of the ensemble nodes (of 3 or 5 total) is not available. The database still has quorum and is operational.
*Corrective Action*::
Verify power for all nodes and their network connectivity. Wait 10 minutes and check that the fault status has changed to Resolved. If the condition persists, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
DBS has lost network connectivity or power an ensemble node. Cluster fault type %s, fault ID %u, status %u. %s
*Parameters*::
*cfType* (STRING): DBS cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): DBS cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*cfDetails* (STRING): Description of the degraded ensemble.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): DBS cluster fault externalSource label created by the CreateClusterFault API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.
