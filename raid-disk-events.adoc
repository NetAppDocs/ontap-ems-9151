== raid.disk.predictiveFailure
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when some condition of the disk indicates that it may fail soon. It is first marked as prefailed. If an appropriate spare is available, it will be selected for Rapid RAID Recovery. In that process, the prefailed disk will be copied to the spare. The filer will stop using the prefailed disk when copying is done. At that time, the disk may be removed and replaced.
*Corrective Action*::
The raid.rg.diskcopy.done event is issued when the disk copy is complete. After that wait for the event message raid.disk.unload.done or raid.carrier.remove to be issued and then replace the carrier containing the failed disk. If the disk is contained in a single-disk carrier, raid.disk.unload.done will be issued immediately. Otherwise, wait for raid.carrier.remove which indicates the carrier has been fully prepared for removal.
