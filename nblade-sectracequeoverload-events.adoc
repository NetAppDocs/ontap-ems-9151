== Nblade.sectraceQueOverload
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when there are too many Sectrace work items. This might be the result of a very generic filter. For example, tracing of succesful NFS accesses can quickly generate a large number of Sectrace items, since all ops (each read or write) might generate a security trace.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the Sectrace filter and make it more specific.
*Syslog Message*::
Too many events [%d] present in SectraceGlobal task queue.
*Parameters*::
*queueSize* (INT): Number of queued events waiting to be processed.
