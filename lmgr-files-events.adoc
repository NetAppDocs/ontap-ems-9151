== lmgr.files.limit.hit
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a lock manager file object cannot be allocated due to reaching the limit for file objects in the associated pool. It is possible that the system is overloaded. Clients will have problems accessing files through NAS protocols while at or above the file object limit.
*Corrective Action*::
Move volumes to a node with a lower utilization of lock manager resources. Lock manager statistics can be displayed from the diagnostic privilege level. Use the "statistics show -raw true -object lmgr_ng" command for displaying all lock manager resource counters. Use the "statistics show -raw true -object lmgr_ng -instance <node-name>" command for displaying the lock manager statistics for a node's limit pool. Use the "statistics show -raw true -object lmgr_ng -node <node-name>" command for displaying all lock manager statistics on the specified node.
*Syslog Message*::
The number of file objects %u has reached the limit %u for the pool %s. The current number/limit of other lock manager objects are: hosts %u/%u locks %u/%u owners %u/%u.
