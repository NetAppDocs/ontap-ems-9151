== snmp.server.busy
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the SNMP daemon is busy serving a high rate of incoming SNMP queries. This might be caused by multiple SNMP clients querying the cluster or a malicious client attempting a denial-of-service attack. SNMP clients might experience delays or timeouts.
*Corrective Action*::
Run "tcpdump" on cluster to determine: If multiple SNMP clients querying the cluster, then reduce the rate of SNMP queries to the cluster or stop them entirely for a period of time (~15 minutes). If a malicious SNMP client is trying a denial-of-service attack, then update the firewall policy to block the client from querying the cluster by using the "firewall policy modify -policy mgmt -service snmp -action deny -ip-list IP_address" command.
*Syslog Message*::
SNMP daemon is busy serving a high rate of incoming SNMP queries.
*Parameters*::
(None).
