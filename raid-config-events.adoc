*Parameters*::
*vol_type* (STRING): Volume type.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the affected aggregate.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.

== raid.config.online.req.badvers
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when an aggregate that appeared to be mountable could not be mounted because the WAFL(R) version is invalid.
*Corrective Action*::
Install a new version of Data ONTAP(R) because the aggregate is from a later version of software.
*Syslog Message*::
This version of Data ONTAP does not recognize the filesystem of %s %s%s. The %s is probably from a later version of the software and is being left unmounted.
*Parameters*::

== raid.config.online.req.inconsist
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event occurs when dynamic assimilation produced an aggregate which appeared to be mountable, but it could not be mounted because the WAFL magic number in the volume information block was incorrect. This is caused by an incomplete aggregate copy or snapmirror initialization.
*Corrective Action*::
Repeat aggr copy or snapmirror initialize that was not completed.
*Syslog Message*::
%s %s%s was left in an inconsistent state by an aborted vol copy or aggr copy copy or an aborted snapmirror initial (level 0) transfer. In order to bring it online, you must either destroy and re-create it, or complete an initial snapmirror transfer or vol copy or aggr copy.
*Parameters*::
*vol_type* (STRING): Volume type.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the affected aggregate.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the aggregate object that could not be mounted.

== raid.config.online.req.mt.iv
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when WAFL(R) attempts to take over a mirror volume that does not have a valid mirror type. This might be caused by upgrading to the current version of Data ONTAP(R), which requires the mirror-type attribute, from a previous version that does not.
*Corrective Action*::
You cannot fix this condition by file system repair mechanisms such as wafliron. The data is not lost, but it is inaccessible as a mirror volume with invalid mirror information, and it cannot be brought online or taken offline. To reclaim the space you can destroy the mirror volume, but this results in the loss of all data on the mirror volume. If you choose to destroy the mirror volume anyway, the command to do so is as follows: 'volume delete -vserver vserver_name -volume vol_name'.
*Syslog Message*::
The mirror type associated with the mirror volume %s %s%s is invalid.
*Parameters*::
*vol_type* (STRING): Type of object (volume/aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the affected volume.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the volume.

== raid.config.online.req.nospace
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event occurs when there is insufficient free space in the containing aggregate to online a flexible volume and apply the flexible volumes space guarantees.
*Corrective Action*::
This error can be corrected by making more space available in the aggregate.
*Syslog Message*::
Containing aggregate does not have enough space to allow %s to be onlined.
*Parameters*::
*vol* (STRING): The name of the flexible volume which could not be onlined.

== raid.config.online.req.ok
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::

*vol_type* (STRING): Volume type.
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the affected aggregate.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the aggregate object that was mounted.
*time* (LONGINT): Time taken to mount the aggregate.

== raid.config.online.req.unsup
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system determines that the deployment in which this aggregate was created does not match the current (clustered or nonclustered) deployment of Data ONTAP(R).
*Corrective Action*::
Bring the aggregate online on a node that matches the clustered or nonclustered deployment in which it was created.
*Syslog Message*::
This deployment of Data ONTAP does not support the file system of '%s %s'. It is being taken offline.
*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Volume type.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.

== raid.config.raidsize.change
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a change to the raidsize parameter is made to match the change made to the raidtype parameter for a given volume or aggregate.
*Corrective Action*::
If the new raidsize is not appropriate, change it with the "storage aggregate modify -aggregate aggregate_name -maxraidsize new_size" command. For cache raidsize change, change it with the "storage aggregate modify -aggregate aggregate_name -cache_raid_group_size new_size" command.
*Syslog Message*::
%s %s%s:%sraidsize is adjusted from %d to %d after changing raidtype.
*Parameters*::
*vol_type* (STRING): Volume type.
*host* (STRING): Owner of the aggregate.
*vol* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.
*cache_string* (STRING): String to indicate if its cache raidsize change. If this is a raidsize change for cache (SSD) RG then the string "cache" will be printed, it is empty otherwise.
*old_size* (INT): Previous raidsize value.
*new_size* (INT): New raidsize value.

== raid.config.rg.size.reminder
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
Size limits for raid4 groups are significantly reduced in Data ONTAP(R) 6.5. Very large raid4 groups do not provide adequate protection from data loss and they are not supported any more. Volumes with large raidgroups should be converted to raid_dp. This message occurs daily as part of system check if some raid groups are too large for raid4 raidtype. That can happen after upgrade from an older version of Data ONTAP with more lax raidsize restrictions. It can also be the result of changing raidtype from raid_dp to raid4. That should be used only to revert to an older version of Data ONTAP. In all other cases, change raidtype of volumes with such large raid groups to raid_dp.
*Corrective Action*::
Change raidtype of the aggregate to raid_dp: "storage aggregate modify -aggregate aggregate_name -raidtype raid_dp"
*Syslog Message*::
Volume %s%s has a raid group larger than the limit for raid4 raidtype (max. raid group size: %d, limit is %d). Convert the volume to raid_dp.
*Parameters*::
*host* (STRING): Owner of the volume.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*rg_size* (INT): Size of the largest raid group in the volume.
*limit* (INT): Size limit for raid4 group.
