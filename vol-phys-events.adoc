== vol.phys.overalloc
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when the volume or aggregate is running dangerously low on free blocks to write to.
*Corrective Action*::
Create space by increasing the volume or aggregate sizes, or by deleting data or deleting Snapshot(R) copies. To increase a volume's size, use the "volume size" command. To delete a volume's Snapshot(R) copies, use the "volume snapshot delete" command. To increase an aggregate's size, add disks by using the "storage aggregate add-disks" command. Aggregate Snapshot(R) copies are deleted automatically when the aggregate is full.
*Syslog Message*::
%s %s%s%s is physically overallocated, using %s%% logical space and %s%% physical space.
*Parameters*::
*object_type* (STRING): Identifier for the type of object to which this event applies (aggregate or volume).
*name* (STRING): Name of this object.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*vserver_uuid* (STRING): Universal Unique ID (UUID) of the object's Vserver, if the object is a volume. Otherwise, this string is empty.
*percent_logically_full* (STRING): Used capacity of the logical space of the object, as a percent. This value can be greater than 100 due to space reserved for metadata. The percentage is computed for the entire object, including Snapshot(R) copy space, and is equivalent to the "Total Used" field in the output of the "volume show-space" or "aggregate show-space" commands.
*percent_physically_full* (STRING): Used capacity of the physical space of the object, as a percent. This value can be greater than 100 due to space reserved for metadata. The percentage is computed for the entire object, including Snapshot(R) copy space, and is equivalent to the "Total Physical Used" field in the output of the "volume show-space" or "aggregate show-space" commands.
