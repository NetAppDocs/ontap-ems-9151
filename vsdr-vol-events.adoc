== vsdr.vol.aff.inline.dedup
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Vserver DR subsystem does not enable inline deduplication on the destination volume. Inline deduplication is not enabled when the destination volume is on neither an AFF system nor a hybrid aggregate.
*Corrective Action*::
If inline deduplication is required on the destination volume, move the volume to a hybrid aggregate, and then enable inline deduplication. For more information, refer to TR-4476.
*Syslog Message*::
Vserver DR: The volume %s of the Vserver %s is on neither an AFF system nor a hybrid aggregate. Therefore, inline deduplication is not enabled on the volume.
*Parameters*::
*destination_volume* (STRING): Name of the destination volume of the Vserver DR relationship.
*destination_vserver* (STRING): Name of the destination Vserver of the Vserver DR relationship.

== vsdr.vol.aggregateoffline
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs during configuration replication, when the aggregate on which the volume needs to be created or modified is either offline or not in the cluster.
*Corrective Action*::
Log in to the cluster and bring the aggregate online by using the "storage aggregate online" command. If the node that owns the aggregate is down, bring it back up.
*Syslog Message*::
Configuration replication for volume "%s" in Vserver "%s" has failed because the aggregate "%s" is offline.
*Parameters*::
*volume_name* (STRING): Volume on which this error occurred.
*aggregate_name* (STRING): Name of the aggregate.
*vserver_name* (STRING): Vserver name for which configuration replication is happening.

== vsdr.vol.clusterlifdown
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs during configuration replication, when the the volume creation fails because the aggregate is not accessible because the cluster logical interface (LIF) is down.
*Corrective Action*::
Log in to the source cluster and run the "network interface show" command to see the state of the cluster LIFs and to identify the down LIFs.Verify that port connectors, cabling, and cluster switch ports are correctly installed and configured.
*Syslog Message*::
Configuration replication for volume "%s" in Vserver "%s" has failed because the cluster LIF is operationally down.
*Parameters*::
*volume_name* (STRING): Volume on which this error occurred.
*vserver_name* (STRING): Vserver name for which configuration replication is happening.

== vsdr.vol.compr.mismatch
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Vserver DR subsystem discovers a mismatch between the compression types of the source and destination volumes, and therefore do not apply the compression type setting of the source volume to the destination volume.
*Corrective Action*::
Undo all off the compression savings on the destination volume, and then modify the compression type of the volume. For more information, refer to TR-4476.
*Syslog Message*::
Vserver DR: Compression type of destination volume %s of Vserver %s is %s, which is different from the source volume compression type %s. Therefore, the compression type of the source volume was not applied on the destination volume.
*Parameters*::
*destination_volume* (STRING): Name of the destination volume of the Vserver DR relationship.
*destination_vserver* (STRING): Name of the destination Vserver of the Vserver DR relationship.

*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support to remove one of the duplicate metadata volumes.
*Syslog Message*::
Configuration replication for metadata volume "%s" in Vserver "%s" has failed because there exists another metadata volume with the same name on the destination cluster.
*Parameters*::
*volume_name* (STRING): Volume on which this error occurred.
*vserver_name* (STRING): Name of the Vserver for which configuration replication is happening.

== vsdr.vol.encryptsrc.plaindst
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when an encrypted volume at the source of a Vserver-DR setup is replicated as a non-encrypted volume at the destination. This can happen if: 1) the key management capability is not enabled at the destination Vserver; 2) the destination Vserver does not have an aggregate that supports encrypted volumes; or 3) the volume of the source Vserver has undergone a conversion operation from non-encrypted to encrypted.
*Corrective Action*::
If necessary, set up the key management capability at the destination by using the "security key-manager setup" command. Ensure that the destination Vserver contains an aggregate that supports encrypted volumes. Use the "snapmirror show" command to determine the type of relationship. If the displayed type is "XDP", encrypt the destination volume by performing a conversion operation from non-encrypted to encrypted using the "volume encryption conversion start" command. However, if the type is "DP", encrypt the destination volume by performing a volume move operation using the "volume move start -encrypt-destination true" command.
*Syslog Message*::
Source volume for volume "%s" in Vserver "%s" is encrypted, but it is replicated as a non-encrypted volume at the destination.
*Parameters*::
*dest_volume_name* (STRING): Name of the destination volume.
*source_vserver_name* (STRING): Name of the source Vserver.
*dest_vserver_name* (STRING): Name of the destination Vserver.

*Corrective Action*::
Unmount the destination volume or mount it at a different path, and then try the operation again.
*Syslog Message*::
Source Vserver "%s" has volume "%s" and junction path "%s" that conflicts with destination Vserver "%s", volume "%s" and the same junction path "%s". Reason: The destination volume is excluded from Vserver DR protection in the reverse direction.
*Parameters*::
*source_vserver_name* (STRING): Name of the source Vserver.
*src_volume_name* (STRING): Name of the source volume.
*src_volume_junction_path* (STRING): Junction path of the source volume.

Snapshots(tm) copies of the parent volume are unlocked and can get deleted, thereby affecting the SnapMirror(R) replication.
*Corrective Action*::
Run "volume move" command to move the volume to the corresponding aggregate.
*Syslog Message*::
The volume "%s" of Vserver "%s" has been moved. It is a clone volume. Move the clone volume as well.
*Parameters*::
*volume_name* (STRING): Volume that has to be manually moved.
*vserver_name* (STRING): Vserver name for which configuration replication is happening.

== vsdr.vol.move.clone.parent
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the parent of a clone volume is moved in a Vserver disaster-recovery (DR) configuration. If the moved volume is deleted or its Snapshot(R) copies are deleted, the SnapMirror(R) transfer fails.
*Corrective Action*::
Run the "volume move" command to move the volume to an appropriate aggregate. If the volume was deleted at the source and the transfer failed, additionally run "snapmirror resync".
*Syslog Message*::
The volume "%s" of Vserver "%s "has been moved. The mirroring of this volume is at risk as it is the parent of a clone volume.
*Parameters*::
*volume_name* (STRING): Volume that has to be manually moved.
*vserver_name* (STRING): Name of the Vserver for which configuration replication is happening.

== vsdr.vol.name.clash
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the source Vserver contains a volume with the same name as one on the destination Vserver, and the volume at the destination is excluded from Vserver Disaster Recovery(DR) Protection in the reverse direction. Future resynchronization attempts might fail unless the problem is resolved.
*Corrective Action*::
Rename the source or the destination volume, and then try the operation again.
*Syslog Message*::
The source Vserver "%s" has a volume with name "%s" while the destination Vserver "%s" has a volume with the same name "%s" that is excluded from Vserver DR Protection in the reverse direction.
*Parameters*::
*source_vserver_name* (STRING): Name of the source Vserver in a Vserver DR setup.
*src_volume_name* (STRING): Name of the volume on the source Vserver.
