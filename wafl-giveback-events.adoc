*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system cannot perform a giveback due to vol create, and must abort giveback.
*Corrective Action*::

*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.

*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.

== wafl.giveback.fence.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system cannot perform a giveback operation because a fence is set on one of the volumes in the aggregate. The giveback operation is aborted.

*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Unique volume identity when the volume name itself is insufficient.

== wafl.giveback.iron.fail
*Severity*::

== wafl.giveback.sp.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system cannot perform a giveback operation because a secure purge operation is being performed on one of the volumes in the aggregate. The giveback operation is aborted.
*Corrective Action*::
A volume in the aggregate is undergoing a secure purge operation. Retry giveback after this operation is complete, or after you abort the operation by using the "volume encryption secure-purge abort" command. If the problem persists, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
A secure purge operation is in progress on %s %s%s%s. Canceling giveback.
*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Unique volume identity when the volume name itself is insufficient.

== wafl.giveback.statusvol.fail
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system cannot perform a giveback due to the volume being used to host wafliron status files.
*Corrective Action*::
Use "aggr wafliron show" command to monitor the status of wafliron and retry giveback after the completion of wafliron that uses the status files hosting volume.
*Syslog Message*::
%s %s%s%s%s is being used by wafliron to host status files. Canceling giveback.
*Parameters*::
*type* (STRING): Type of object (volume or aggregate).
*owner* (STRING): Volume owner.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): To uniquely identify the volume in cases where the volume name itself is insufficient.

== wafl.giveback.vetoedByNvsave
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a high-availability (HA) giveback is vetoed because there are NVSave files for an aggregate or a flexible volume that must be replayed before the aggregate or flexible volume can be given back.
*Corrective Action*::
Retry the giveback operation after the NVSave files either are replayed (by bringing the aggregate or flexible volume online) or are deleted from the root volume. Successful replay, for example, is indicated by the EMS message 'wafl.nvsave.replaying.pass'.
*Syslog Message*::
Giveback vetoed because NVSave files are present for %s FSID %d name %s%s%s. UUID is %s.
*Parameters*::
*vol_type* (STRING): Whether this message refers to NVSave files for an aggregate or a flexible volume.
*fsid* (INT): File system identifier.
*vol* (STRING): Volume name.
*app* (STRING): Application UUID.
*volident* (STRING): Unique identifier of the volume in cases in which the volume name itself is insufficient.
*UUID* (STRING): UUID of the volume.
