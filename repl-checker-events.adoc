== repl.checker.block.missing
*Severity*::
EMERGENCY
*Description*::
This message occurs when a SnapMirror(R) check command detects a missing block on a SnapMirror(R) destination volume and the volume might be in an inconsistent state that should be fixed as soon as possible.
*Corrective Action*::
Run WAFL check or wafliron as soon as possible to clear this inconsistency and rebuild from the source or resynchronize. If the block is found to be in a Snapshot copy by running 'vol vbncheck' command, deleting the Snapshot copy should remove the inconsistency. Please contact NetApp technical support for more options.
*Syslog Message*::
Snapmirror check on volume %s has detected a missing block at volume block number %llu. It is strongly recommended that you run WAFL check or wafliron to clear this inconsistency. Failure to do so might lead to node panic at any time.
*Parameters*::
*volname* (STRING): Volume name
*vvbn* (LONGINT): Virtual volume block number of the missing block.
