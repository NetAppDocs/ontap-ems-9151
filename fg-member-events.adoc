== fg.member.below.threshold
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when a members available space is below the threshold. ONTAP will be reporting zero space for the entire flexgroup.
*Corrective Action*::
Correct the problem based on the reason specified. If the error persists, contact NetApp technical support for further assistance.
*Syslog Message*::
FlexGroup volume "%s" (Size: "%lu", Usage: "%lu"%%) has member volume "%s" (Size: "%lu", Usage: "%lu"%%) that is at or below the free space threshold of "%lu" blocks.
*Parameters*::
*flexgroupName* (STRING): Name of the FlexGroup volume.
*flexgroupSize* (LONGINT): Size in blocks of the FlexGroup volume.
*flexgroupUsage* (LONGINT): Usage percentage of the FlexGroup volume.
*memberName* (STRING): Name of the FlexGroup member volume.
*memberSize* (LONGINT): Size in blocks of the FlexGroup member volume.
*memberUsage* (LONGINT): Usage percentage of the FlexGroup member volume.
*thresholdSize* (LONGINT): Size of threshold that has been reached.

== fg.member.elastic.sizing
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a constituent volume in a FlexGroup volume undergoes elastic sizing either to restore balance among constituent volumes or to resize them to accommodate space needs.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Constituent volume "%u" in FlexGroup volume "%s" was resized from %lu blocks to %lu blocks. This constituent volume (%s) %s by resizing the constituent volume "%s" (dsid "%u"). This constituent volume is %llu bytes in size with %llu bytes used (%u percent full). The FlexGroup volume is %llu bytes in size with %llu bytes used (%u percent full).
*Parameters*::
*constituent_dsid* (INT): DSID of the constituent volume undergoing elastic sizing.
*object_name* (STRING): Name of the FlexGroup volume.
*current_size* (LONGINT): Original block size of the constituent volume.
*new_size* (LONGINT): New block size of the constituent volume.
*constituent_name* (STRING): Name of the constituent volume.
*operation* (STRING): Indicates whether the constituent volume is being grown or shrunk.
*partner_name* (STRING): Name of the constituent volume's partner.
*partner_dsid* (INT): DSID of the constituent volume's partner.
*size* (LONGINT): Size in bytes of the constituent volume.
*used* (LONGINT): Size in bytes of the used space of the constituent volume.
*percent_full* (INT): Percentage of filled space in the constituent volume.
*flexgroup_size* (LONGINT): Size in bytes of the FlexGroup volume.
*flexgroup_used* (LONGINT): Size in bytes of the used space in the FlexGroup volume.
*flexgroup_percent_full* (INT): Percentage of filled space in the FlexGroup volume.
*event_time* (LONGINT): When the event occurred, shown in system time.
