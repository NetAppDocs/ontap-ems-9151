== mgr.boot.unequalDist
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs during system initialization when the local system finds that the number of disks that it can use to create a partitioned root aggregate is different than on the partner node.
*Corrective Action*::
To create a system with an equal number of automatically partitioned disks on the local and partner systems: 1. Make sure that any failed disks in the internal shelf are replaced. 2. Remove ownership from all disks. The system automatically assigns one half of the disks to the local system and the other half to the partner node. To remove disk ownership, boot into maintenance mode and manually remove ownership by using the "disk remove_ownership" command.
*Syslog Message*::
Warning: Unequal number of disks will be used for auto-partitioning of the root aggregate on the local system and HA partner. The local system will use %d disks but the HA partner will use %d disks. To correct this situation, boot both controllers into maintenance mode and remove the ownership of all disks.
*Parameters*::
*n_local* (INT): Number of partitionable disks that are used by the local system.
*n_partner* (INT): Number of partitionable disks that are used by the partner system.
