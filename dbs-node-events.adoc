== dbs.node.maint.mode.alert
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when Distributed Block Store (DBS) detects a node with a maintenance mode failure.
*Corrective Action*::
Contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
DBS has detected a node with a maintenance mode failure. Cluster fault node %u, node UUID %s, type %s, fault ID %u, status %u. %s
*Parameters*::
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Node UUID string of the associated node.
*cfType* (STRING): DBS cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): DBS cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*cfDetails* (STRING): Details of the node in maintenance mode.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): DBS cluster fault externalSource label created by the CreateClusterFault API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.

== dbs.node.maint.mode.error
