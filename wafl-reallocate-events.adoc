== wafl.reallocate.aggr.interrupt
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This message occurs when an aggregate reallocation scan is interrupted. The scan was scheduled using the 'reallocate -A' command.
*Corrective Action*::
None required.
*Syslog Message*::
Aggregate reallocation scan on '%s' was interrupted.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): Scan path.

== wafl.reallocate.check.high
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued if an allocation check scan (issued before reallocation starts) returns indicating that the path requires reallocation.
*Corrective Action*::
None required. The reallocation scan will automatically be started.
*Syslog Message*::
Allocation check on '%s' is %d, hotspot %d (threshold %d), so will reallocate.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path
*optim* (INT): The current optimization of the path
*hot_spot* (INT): The current hot-spot optimization of the path
*threshold* (INT): The reallocation threshold of the path

== wafl.reallocate.check.highAdvise
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued if an allocation check scan returns indicating that the path would benefit from reallocation.
*Corrective Action*::
Consider reallocating the path (see na_reallocate(1))
*Syslog Message*::
Allocation check on '%s' is %d, hotspot %d (threshold %d), consider running reallocate.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path
*optim* (INT): The current optimization of the path
*hot_spot* (INT): The current hot-spot optimization of the path
*threshold* (INT): The reallocation threshold of the path

== wafl.reallocate.check.value
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued to report the optimization of a path.
*Corrective Action*::
None required.
*Syslog Message*::
Allocation measurement check on '%s' is %d.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path
*optim* (INT): The path optimization.

== wafl.reallocate.full.done
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued to report the completion of a full, one-time, reallocation scan.
*Corrective Action*::
None required.
*Syslog Message*::
Full reallocation on '%s' is complete.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path

== wafl.reallocate.full.interrupt
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued to report that a full, one-time, reallocation scan was interrupted.
*Corrective Action*::
None required.
*Syslog Message*::
Full reallocation on '%s' was interrupted.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path

== wafl.reallocate.path.invalid
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event is issued if an invalid scan path is detected.
*Corrective Action*::
Check why the scan path is invalid, including file removal or volume offline. If the condition is persistent remove the associated reallocation scan.
*Syslog Message*::
Unavailable/invalid reallocation path '%s' detected.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path

== wafl.reallocate.recheck.ok
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued if an allocation recheck scan (issued after reallocation has completed) returns indicating the optimization is under the threshold.
*Corrective Action*::
None required.
*Syslog Message*::
Allocation check on '%s' is under threshold.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The scan path

== wafl.reallocate.scan.exists
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued if an attempt is made to add a new reallocation scan but a scan job already exists for the supplied path.
*Corrective Action*::
Check the path is correct. If it is correct then delete the previous reallocation job, and add a new one. Use the 'reallocate status' command to list reallocation jobs.
*Syslog Message*::
A reallocation scan for %s already exists.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The path with the scan.

== wafl.reallocate.scan.noStart
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
Reallocation tasks, such as measuring the layout of a file or performing block reallocation, may be perfomed using an asynchronous WAFL scanner. This event is issued if an error occurs unexpectedly while trying to start such a WAFL scanner.
*Corrective Action*::
(Call support).
*Syslog Message*::
reallocate: unable to start '%s' scanner for '%s': %d (%s)
*Parameters*::
*scan_type* (STRING): The type of scan operation.
*path* (STRING): The scan path or aggregate name.
*err_code* (INT): A numerical error code indicating the reason why the scanner could not be started.
*err_string* (STRING): A string interpreting the err_code.

== wafl.reallocate.scan.remove
*Severity*::
INFORMATIONAL
*Description*::
This event is issued when a reallocation job is persistently removed from the system.
*Corrective Action*::
None required.
*Syslog Message*::
Reallocation scan for '%s' is being removed.
*Parameters*::
*path* (STRING): The path with the scan.

== wafl.reallocate.schedule.invalid
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This event is issued if an invalid reallocation schedule is detected.
*Corrective Action*::
Correct the schedule syntax then retry the operation
*Syslog Message*::
Invalid schedule: %s
*Parameters*::
*reason* (STRING): The reason why the schedule is invalid
