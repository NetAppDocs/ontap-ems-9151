== raid.multierr.bad.block
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when RAID encounters more errors than the RAID level protection affords, and RAID cannot recover the block. The blocks with errors are marked as bad. When the file system reads this bad block, an error is returned. The file system identifies the bad file and block and recommends the necessary corrective action.
*Corrective Action*::
Check for the WAFL(R) message "wafl.raid.incons.xxx" and follow the corrective actions outlined there.
*Syslog Message*::
Marking '%s%s', block number %llu, volume block number %llu, as a bad block.
*Parameters*::
*owner* (STRING): Owner of the affected aggregate.
*disk_info* (STRING): Formatted information of the disk object that contains the error.
*blockNum* (LONGINT): Physical block number containing the error.
*volumeBno* (LONGINT): Volume block number.
*shelf* (STRING): Shelf identifier where the disk is located.
*bay* (STRING): Disk bay within the shelf where the disk is located.
*vendor* (STRING): Name of the disk vendor.
*model* (STRING): Model string of the disk.
*firmware_revision* (STRING): Firmware revision number of the disk.
*serialno* (STRING): Serial number of the disk.
*disk_type* (INT): Type of disk.
*disk_rpm* (STRING): Rotational speed of the disk, in RPM.

== raid.multierr.cksum.bno
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system detects a block number mismatch during an error recovery operation. The expected Virtual Block Number (VBN)/Disk Block Number (DBN) is not the same as the stored VBN/DBN from the checksum entry, indicating that the block is read from the wrong location. Data ONTAP(R) makes appropriate recovery actions. Other events describe those actions.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).

Block number mismatch on %s%s: stored_dbn = %u, expected_dbn = %llu; stored_vbn = %llu, expected_vbn = %llu during an error recovery operation.
