== config.move.fail.lost.lif.address
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a logical interface (LIF) migration fails in such a way that there might have been a resulting internal loss of the LIF IP address.
*Corrective Action*::
Use the "network interface modify" command to toggle the LIF's "-status-admin" parameter down and then up. This reinstalls the LIF address in the network stack.
*Syslog Message*::
LIF migration for IP address %s from port %s to port %s failed because of an internal error: %s.
*Parameters*::
*address* (STRING): LIF IPv4 or IPv6 address being moved.
*migrateFromPort* (STRING): Name of the migrate-from port.
*migrateToPort* (STRING): Name of the migrate-to port.
*internalError* (STRING): Internal error message.
