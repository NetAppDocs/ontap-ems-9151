== qos.mintp.high.intrconct.lat
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the Quality of Service (QoS) subsystem notices high latency in the cluster interconnect for workloads associated with minimum-throughput policy groups. As a result, workloads might not be able to meet their minimum-throughput values.
*Corrective Action*::
Consider using the "qos statistics" CLI command to monitor the workloads and policy groups that have high cluster interconnect latency and also do not meet their minimum-throughput Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Either avoid the interconnect by moving workloads or LIFs, or reduce contention for the interconnect by applying QoS maximum throughput constraints on interfering workloads.
*Syslog Message*::
QoS has noticed high cluster interconnect latency. Some workloads and policy groups might not meet their specified minimum-throughput.
*Parameters*::
(None).
