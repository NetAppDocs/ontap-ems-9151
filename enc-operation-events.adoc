== enc.operation.aborted
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when either the rekeying of an encrypted flexible volume, or the conversion of the volume from unencrypted to encrypted, has been aborted.
*Corrective Action*::
Determine the cause of the error by using either the "volume encryption rekey show -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume-name>" command or the "volume encryption conversion show -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume-name>" command. Correct the error. If the error was related to rekeying, continue the operation by using the "volume encryption rekey resume -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume-name>" command. If the error was related to conversion to encryption, continue the operation by using the "volume encryption conversion resume -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume-name>" command.
*Syslog Message*::
%s scan is aborted in the volume '%s' (aggr '%s'). Reason: %s.
*Parameters*::
*op* (STRING): Rekey or conversion operation.
*volume* (STRING): Volume name.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the containing aggregate.
*status* (STRING): Status of the scan.

== enc.operation.completed
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when rekey or conversion to encryption operation is completed in a flexible volume.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
%s operation is completed in the volume '%s' (aggr '%s').
*Parameters*::
*op* (STRING): Rekey or conversion operation.
*volume* (STRING): Volume name.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the containing aggregate.

== enc.operation.disableAid
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system automatically disables the Aggregate Inline Deduplication (AID) feature for a volume as it is converted from a non-encrypted volume to an encrypted volume because AID is not supported for an encrypted volume.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
AID is disabled for volume %s within aggregate %s during conversion to encryption operation.
*Parameters*::
*volume* (STRING): Volume name.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the containing aggregate.

== enc.operation.failure
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when there is a failure in encryption operation. The operation description explains the nature of operation and reason for failure.
*Corrective Action*::
Ensure that there is enough space in the aggregate, cluster is healthy, volume location database is online, and then retry the volume encryption operation.
*Syslog Message*::
Failure in %s operation on volume '%s' (aggr '%s'). Reason '%s'.
*Parameters*::
*op* (STRING): Rekey or conversion operation.
*volume* (STRING): Volume name.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the containing aggregate.
*desc* (STRING): Describes the reason for the failure of operation with arguments.

== enc.operation.started
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when rekey or conversion to encryption operation is started in a flexible volume.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
%s operation is started in the volume '%s' (aggr '%s').
*Parameters*::
*op* (STRING): Rekey or conversion operation.
*volume* (STRING): Volume name.
*aggr* (STRING): Name of the containing aggregate.
