== adt.cmdthrd.create.fail
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when audit initialization fails because the necessary execution threads cannot be created.
*Corrective Action*::
Available system resources are required for this feature to function. The best way to accomplish that is through a system reboot. For HA configurations, operational disruption can be minimized by initiating a partner takeover followed by a reboot of this partner. After the reboot is complete, issue a "giveback" command to return services to this partner.
*Syslog Message*::
Audit subsystem internal error: Could not start required audit command threads, system reboot might be required.
*Parameters*::
(None).
