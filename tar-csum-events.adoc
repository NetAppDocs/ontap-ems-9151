(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Checksum of %s could not be calculated.
*Parameters*::
*tgz_path* (STRING): Path to the archive for which the checksum calculation failed.

== tar.csum.extractFailed
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system accesses a TAR archive and compares the calculated checksum of the archive to a stored checksum, but the extraction of such an archive fails.
