== wafl.scan.abort.nospace
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when the system is aborting the WORM clear scan because there is no space available in the volume.

Create space by increasing the volume or aggregate sizes, or by deleting data or deleting Snapshottm copies. To increase a volume's size, use the "volume size" command. To delete a volume's Snapshot copies, use the "volume snapshot delete" command. To increase an aggregate's size, add disks by using the "storage aggregate add-disks" command. Aggregate Snapshot copies are deleted automatically when the aggregate is full.
