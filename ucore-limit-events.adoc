== ucore.limit.exceeded
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a userspace core is not dumped because the limit for the directory has been exceeded. This happens before the mroot is mounted, and the CompactFlash(R) card is used as a temporary dump location.
*Corrective Action*::
Move the core off the /cfcard directory if the system has not done so automatically.
*Syslog Message*::
'Exceeded limit for directory %s.'
*Parameters*::
*directory_name* (STRING): Current coredump directory.
