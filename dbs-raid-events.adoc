== dbs.raid.group.degraded
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when distributed block store detects that a RAID group in the cluster is degraded. The RAID group can continue to serve data, but performance might be adversely affected.
*Corrective Action*::
Look for disk error EMS messages, or use REST, Kubernetes, or kubectl calls to check for disk errors. If the errors cannot be resolved, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Distributed block store has detected a degraded RAID group. Cluster fault node %u, node UUID %s, type %s, fault ID %u, status %u. %s
*Parameters*::
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Node universal unique identifier (UUID) string of the associated node.
*cfType* (STRING): Distributed block store cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): Distributed block store cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*cfDetails* (STRING): Details of the degraded RAID group.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): Distributed block store cluster fault externalSource label created by the "CreateClusterFault" API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.

== dbs.raid.group.not.oper
*Severity*::
ALERT
*Description*::
This message occurs when distributed block store detects that a RAID group is not operational and is unable to serve data.
*Corrective Action*::
Look for disk error EMS messages, or use REST, Kubernetes, or kubectl calls to check for disk errors. If the errors cannot be resolved, contact NetApp technical support.
*Syslog Message*::
Distributed block store has detected a nonoperational RAID group. Cluster fault node %u, node UUID %s, type %s, fault ID %u, status %u. %s
*Parameters*::
*nodeID* (INT): Node ID number of the associated node.
*nodeUuid* (STRING): Node universal unique identifier (UUID) string of the associated node.
*cfType* (STRING): Distributed block store cluster fault type of the associated object.
*cfID* (INT): Distributed block store cluster fault ID number associated with the fault.
*cfStatus* (INT): Current status of the cluster fault. 1 = New (just reported), 2 = Existing (updated), 3 = Resolved (closed).
*cfDetails* (STRING): Details of the RAID group that is not operational.
*cfExtSrc* (STRING): Distributed block store cluster fault externalSource label created by the "CreateClusterFault" API command and attached to the fault for testing purposes.
