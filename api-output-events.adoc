*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when An invalid character was detected while checking the output for a Data ONTAP(R) API. All Data ONTAP API output must be valid UTF-8 characters. From time to time invalid output is detected. Most often this is due to hardware errors, for example, a disk-list-info API might query a disk drive for its serial number but receive invalid data from a malfunctioning drive.
*Corrective Action*::
Examine the information in detailInfo to see if it pinpoints defective hardware. If an API name is provided, that API can be executed to determine which field in the API output is being given invalid data.
*Syslog Message*::
(None).
