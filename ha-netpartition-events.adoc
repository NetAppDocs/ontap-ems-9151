== ha.netPartition
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Data ONTAP(R) subsystem detects an error potentially due to network partitioning, but cannot take over the partner node or allow the partner to take over because both takeover-of-partner and takeover-by-partner are both disabled. Network partitioning is indicated by concurrent errors on more than one of a node's interfaces, if a halt, reboot, takeover or similar action affecting connectivity is not already in progress.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Network partition error. Internal error code %d; status: 0x%x; internal request ID: %d.
*Parameters*::
*error_code* (INT): Internal error code.
*error_status* (INTHEX): Additional internal status bits related to error_code.
*req_id* (INT): Internal request ID.
*duration* (LONGINT): Elapsed time in msecs spent resolving the reported error.

== ha.netPartition.reboot
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Data ONTAP(R) subsystem detects an error potentially due to network partitioning, and reboots the local node due to the network partition. The reboot occurs only if ` takeover-by-partner is enabled on the local node. Network partitioning is indicated by concurrent errors on more than one of a node's interfaces, if a halt, reboot, takeover or similar action affecting connectivity is not already in progress.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Rebooting the local node due to a network partition error. Internal error code %d; status: 0x%x; internal request ID: %d.
*Parameters*::
*error_code* (INT): Internal error code.
*error_status* (INTHEX): Additional internal status bits related to error_code.
*req_id* (INT): Internal request ID.
*duration* (LONGINT): Elapsed time in msecs spent resolving the reported error.

== ha.netPartition.takeover
*Severity*::
NOTICE
*Description*::
This message occurs when a Data ONTAP(R) subsystem detects an error potentially due to network partitioning, and initiates a takeover of the partner node due to the partition. Network partitioning is indicated by concurrent errors on more than one of a node's interfaces, if a halt, reboot, takeover or similar action affecting connectivity is not already in progress.
*Corrective Action*::
(None).
*Syslog Message*::
Taking over the partner node due to a network partition error. Internal error code %d; status: 0x%x; internal request ID: %d.
*Parameters*::
*error_code* (INT): Internal error code.
*error_status* (INTHEX): Additional internal status bits related to error_code.
*req_id* (INT): Internal request ID.
*duration* (LONGINT): Elapsed time in msecs spent resolving the reported error.
