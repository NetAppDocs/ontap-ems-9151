== san.slmSupportCheckFailed
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs during reboot when SAN capability is enabled, the cluster has more than 8 nodes and lun.reporting.nodes options is disabled. It leads to host instability as the number of paths exposed exceeds the threshold that the host stacks can handle.
*Corrective Action*::
Set the option "lun.reporting_nodes.enable" to "on" with the command "vserver options lun.reporting_nodes.enable on" and enable Selective LUN Map on existing maps with the command "lun mapping add-reporting-nodes -vserver * -path * -igroup * -local-nodes".
*Syslog Message*::
Clusters with more than 8 nodes must have SLM support enabled.
*Parameters*::
(None).
